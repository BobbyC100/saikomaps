**Date:** February 9, 2026  
**Status:** All 7 hierarchy fixes implemented  
**Test URL:** http://localhost:3000/place/stir-crazy

---

## ✅ Completed Fixes

### Fix 1: Meta Line — Meal Context ✅
**Changed:** Replaced generic "EAT" category with time-based meal context

**Logic implemented:**
- Opens before noon → `Lunch` or `Daytime`
- Opens 5 PM or later → `Dinner`
- Opens 9 PM or later → `Late Night`
- No data available → Omit meal descriptor, show only `Neighborhood · $$`

**Example for Stir Crazy (opens 5 PM):**
```
Before: EAT · MELROSE · $$
After:  Dinner · Melrose · $$
```

**Files changed:**
- `components/merchant/HeroSection.tsx` — Added `getMealContext()` helper
- `app/(viewer)/place/[slug]/page.tsx` — Pass `hours` prop to HeroSection

---

### Fix 2: Status — Remove Duplicate ✅
**Changed:** Removed status indicator from Hours card (kept in Hero only)

**Before (Hours Card):**
```
HOURS
5:00 – 11:00 PM
● CLOSED · OPENS 11 PM   ← Removed
See all hours
```

**After (Hours Card):**
```
HOURS
5:00 – 11:00 PM
See all hours
```

**Files changed:**
- `components/merchant/HoursCard.tsx` — Removed status row rendering

---

### Fix 3: Action Strip — Spacing ✅
**Changed:** Increased gap and padding for better visual presence

**Changes:**
```css
gap: 4px → 16px         /* More breathing room between actions */
padding: 8px 14px → 10px 18px  /* Larger tap targets */
```

**Files changed:**
- `components/merchant/ActionStrip.module.css`

---

### Fix 4: Share Button — Editorial Icon ✅
**Changed:** Replaced system share icon with editorial arrow (↗)

**Implementation:**
- Icon: `ArrowUpRight` from lucide-react
- Styling: Thin stroke (1.5px), subtle opacity (0.6), no background circle
- Drop shadow for contrast against photos
- Size: 16px (up from 14px for better visibility)

**Files changed:**
- `components/merchant/HeroSection.tsx` — Changed icon from `Share2` to `ArrowUpRight`
- `components/merchant/HeroSection.module.css` — Removed circular background, simplified styling

---

### Fix 5: Gallery — 3-col Collage ✅
**Verified:** Gallery already implements 2×3 thumbnail grid correctly

**Structure confirmed:**
- Grid span: 3 columns (expandable to 6 if no Curator)
- Internal layout: `repeat(3, 1fr)` — shows 6 thumbnails in 2 rows
- Aspect ratio: 1:1 square thumbnails with `object-fit: cover`
- Overflow indicator: Shows `+N` on last thumbnail if >6 photos

**Graceful degradation working:**
- No Curator → Gallery expands to 6-col
- Fewer than 6 photos → Shows available photos, grid adapts

**Files verified:**
- `components/merchant/GalleryCard.tsx` — Already correct
- `components/merchant/GalleryCard.module.css` — Already correct
- `app/(viewer)/place/[slug]/page.tsx` — Graceful degradation logic working

---

### Fix 6: Details Card — Website Clean-up ✅
**Changed:** Improved website domain formatting

**Logic implemented:**
```javascript
// Strip protocol (https://, http://)
// Strip www subdomain
// Keep meaningful subdomains (order.stircrazy.la)
// Special handling for linktree/link aggregators (keep path)
// Remove trailing slash
```

**Examples:**
```
https://www.stircrazy.la/menu → stircrazy.la
https://order.stircrazy.la → order.stircrazy.la
https://linktr.ee/stircrazy → linktr.ee/stircrazy
```

**Instagram already removed:** Details card only shows Website, Part of, Service, Reservations, Parking (no duplication with Action Strip)

**Files changed:**
- `components/merchant/DetailsCard.tsx` — Added `formatWebsiteDomain()` helper

---

### Fix 7: Vibe Card — Verification ✅
**Verified:** VibeCard properly integrated and renders correctly

**Implementation confirmed:**
- Component: `components/merchant/VibeCard.tsx` ✅
- Integration: `app/(viewer)/place/[slug]/page.tsx` line 476-478 ✅
- Grid span: 6 columns (full width) ✅
- **Deprecated:** VibeCard and vibeTags removed from entities. Vibe signals now in `identity_signals.vibe_words` via SceneSense.

**Files verified:**
- `components/merchant/VibeCard.tsx` — Component correct
- `app/(viewer)/place/[slug]/page.tsx` — Properly imported and rendered
