      "content": "Sqirl has long been ripe for parody. During its 2010s heyday, this daytime Virgil Village spot was often a punchline for tired jokes about green juice, avocado toast, and macrobiotic grain bowls—even as it did those items better than anyone else in town. Then came the moldy jam scandal, an internet-fueled controversy that, even today, people still snicker about in line. But through it all, Sqirl has remained more or less the same: a reliable, walk-up cafe with good food and even better people-watching.\n\nIf you've never been to Sqirl—or haven't been in a while—let us set the scene: Everyone waits in line and orders at the counter, scrambles passive-aggressively for a sidewalk table, and takes group selfies while waiting for their ricotta toast to arrive. In other words, not much has changed here since the start of Obama's second term.\n\nAnd though you might imagine the lines are shorter these days, let us dispel that myth—the crowds are still very real. On a recent Sunday afternoon, we spent 20 minutes in line to order and another 40 minutes waiting for food. A visit on an early Tuesday morning yielded similar results.\n\nSquirl's menu has grown, but you'll find the same tried and true array of toasts, bowls, sandwiches, leafy salads, pastries, and heartier breakfast plates like shakshuka and french omelets, plus a small chalkboard of daily specials. There's also a grab-and-go area next door called Sqirl Away, where you'll find salads and sandwiches packaged for takeout.\n\nEven with all the additions, however, the classic staples should be your priority. Dishes like the dill-laced sorrel pesto rice and inch-thick brioche french toast are just as good as they were when Breaking Bad was airing.\n\nSquirl isn't perfect. The consistent wait for food can be annoying and hot dishes tend to arrive at room temperature, particularly at peak hours. There are also plenty of dishes outside the classics that aren't more memorable than what you'd find at a typical all-day cafe. At its best though, Sqirl is a pleasant slice of LA idiosyncrasy: a place to go with post-workout friends and sip a turmeric tonic, take an overhead photo of a piece of toast, and maybe reminisce about simpler times. If you can't allow yourself that, the joke's probably on you."

Bib Gourmands are awarded to restaurants where diners can enjoy two high-quality courses and a glass of wine or dessert for $40 or less, and as we noted in March, not even an army of Michelin's anonymous inspectors could fully cover and rate the taqueros and tucked-away strip-mall spots that define the city and that category."

      "content": "Sqirl forever changed how Angelenos think about breakfast when it opened in Virgil Village in 2012. From latke tots to crispy rice salads, chef/owner Jessica Koslow pioneered an inventive, genre-defying style that inspired legions of all-day cafes and breakfast-forward menus for years to come. And beginning on Feb. 19, a new chapter begins: Sqirl will launch its first-ever dinner service, marking a long-anticipated evolution for a restaurant that essentially created its own genre of California cuisine.\n\nDinner at Sqirl isn't a pivot so much as a delayed inevitability. \"It's always been something I wanted to do,\" Koslow says. Trained in fine dining pastry, she's long envisioned Sqirl beyond just breakfast and lunch. What held it all back was logistics, most notably the lack of a full liquor license. Their sliver-sized, 800-square-foot space previously didn't qualify, but a pandemic-era regulatory change via the Restaurant Beverage Program made it possible for Sqirl to finally apply. The license finally came through in December 2024—followed almost immediately by fires, ICE disruptions, and staffing delays.\n\nSquirl's dinner menu exists in its own cuisine category. While Koslow describes the new nighttime vibe as bistro-like, its influences are myriad: everything from her own British/Jewish heritage to California seasonality to French technique to the various backgrounds of her kitchen team. To start, enjoy bread service with fermented Nardello butter and Nardello jam, appetizers like shima aji crudo; wagyu beef tartare with burnt negi; Jidori chicken liver parfait with celery butter; and of course, a Sqirl take on a Caesar salad (think croissant croutons and parm)."
