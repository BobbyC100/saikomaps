      "content": "Sometimes a bean and cheese burrito is just a bean and cheese. But not at Al & Bea's. The humble burrito is a beloved staple at this 50-year-old Boyle Heights institution, and every time we order one, we're reminded how fantastic something filled with just two ingredients (three if you count the famous green salsa) can be. Head to Al & Bea's on a Saturday afternoon and you'll find the whole neighborhood ordering from the small takeout window and hanging out on picnic tables—families, high school dates, local beat cops, and everyone in between. The kitchen also does retro Mexican classics like fried tacos, tostadas, and guacamole fries, but none of them are memorable enough that they should distract from that simple but glorious burrito. As unremarkable as it looks, there's some kind of magic happening in this basic bean and cheese. Perhaps it's because the silky-smooth refried beans are so hot when they're wrapped up in the flour tortilla, they don't just melt with the shredded orange cheese—they create this textural moment that's hard to explain but impossible not to love. Whatever it is, we're here for it. The crunchy-shell shredded beef tacos at Al & Bea's are decent and are a nice way to round out a burrito lunch, but they're not the main reason we'd send you here. Ordering your tacos with \"everything\" means a splat of loose guacamole on top, which is tasty, but does turn the whole thing into a bit of a mess."
