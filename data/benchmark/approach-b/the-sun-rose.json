      "content": "There's no one location in Los Angeles that captures the appeal of the whole city, but the Sunset Strip comes close — Hollywood glamour, rock-and-roll decadence, spectacularly set against the backdrop of the hills. The Sun Rose takes up a whole block along Sunset, and it needs every square foot; the Pendry contains not just 149 rooms and suites, but a spa, a pair of Wolfgang Puck restaurants, a members' club, a 100-seat music venue, and even a bowling alley. The design, by Martin Brudnizki, is influenced by the Art Deco interiors that are synonymous with Hollywood's Golden Age, but the Pendry is no retro experience — instead it's a fantasy version of contemporary L.A., full of dazzling colors and textures, beginning with Anthony James's mind-bending Icosahedron, a fractal-like sculpture in the lobby which draws the viewer's eye into a seemingly limitless interior world."
