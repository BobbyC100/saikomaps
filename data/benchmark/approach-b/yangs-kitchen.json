      "content": "This critically acclaimed SGV eatery known for its brunch now offers a unique, destination-worthy dinner service. From the beginning, Chris Yang and Maggie Ho's Chinese-inspired California cuisine has been beloved by locals and critics alike. In 2019, when the couple first opened their Alhambra restaurant, Yang's Kitchen, as an all-day fast-casual concept, diners raved about the beef noodle soup and scallion pancakes made with locally sourced, high-quality ingredients. These labor-intensive dishes went away during the pandemic, as the couple figured out what worked, financially speaking, and what didn't. In 2021, Yang's Kitchen reopened with a streamlined brunch service, including a noteworthy Japanese breakfast-like set meal and a cornmeal mochi pancake topped with seasonal fruit. In November 2022, the restaurant introduced dinner service, which runs Thursday through Sunday nights. Highly inventive yet tinged with nostalgia, Yang's Kitchen has turned into the new-school Chinese evening destination. In a similar vein to Santa Monica's now-closed Cassia, where the couple worked before opening Yang's, the restaurant (still) sources the majority of its ingredients locally, and organic whenever possible. The menu board above the counter lists the farmers and producers that have made your meal possible. Management also strives to pay living wages to employees and cut down on food waste; each check includes a 1% surcharge benefitting Zero Foodprint, a climate change nonprofit. Drawing on Ho's Taiwanese roots, and Yang's Cantonese and Vietnamese ones, the end result is distinctly Asian American cuisine. The food: Asian-inflected comfort food dishes with a farm-to-table sensibility. Highlights include the Hainan fish rice, dan dan campanelle and the prawn ceviche. The drink: An interesting and varied wine and sake list, plus non-alcoholic options, including coffee and tea."

      "content": "When Yang's Kitchen opened in 2019, it had our immediate attention. The order-at-the-counter Taiwanese-ish restaurant in Alhambra was a breath of fresh air, serving delicious, creative food in a space that felt like the breezy, second-floor cafe of an upscale bookstore. We even put it on our Best New Restaurants Of 2019 list, enshrining our affection for this inventive neighborhood spot. Fast forward to today—with a year-long pandemic closure sprinkled in—and Yang's is back with full dinner service, marking a new era for an operation that was previously daytime-only. With a well-curated natural wine list, thoughtful local sourcing, and a new lineup of profoundly original dishes, we can say with confidence that this is the most exciting version of Yang's yet. Yang's daytime menu is more straightforward than dinner, but it still has plenty of standout signatures, most of all the salmon smoked hash. There's one big difference now, though: the letter boards that hang above the back counter no longer list the menu. That's because Yang's is now full-service and also because one of the boards now highlights the local producers and farmers that Yang's sources its ingredients from. The other highlights the restaurant's commitment to sustainable food systems, paying employees living wages, and working with Zero Footprint, a non-profit that fights climate change through agricultural practices. It's a level of intentionality and transparency that is not often seen in most big name restaurants, let alone a tiny cafe in the SGV. Head to Yang's during the day and you'll find a menu of straightforward dishes that are designed to arrive quickly and fill you up. Think set meals with rice, soup, soy egg, and a protein of choice like braised tofu or chicken thighs. There are also customizable breakfast plates and big helpings of cold sesame noodles. We love Yang's for quick breakfast or lunch when we're in the area, but come dinnertime, the place transforms into something else: a full-on dining destination. During evenings at Yang's, the lights are dimmed, soft indie music hums on the speakers, and friend groups huddle around tables ordering bottles of orange wine from Puglia at leisure. You'll snack on decadent appetizers like creamy smoked fish dip with sesame sourdough from Bub & Grandma's and fatty, aromatic pork ribs. And then there are the 'Larger Bites,' a collection of dishes that aren't just the best stuff on the menu, but are what elevates Yang's into the upper echelon of LA's food scene."
