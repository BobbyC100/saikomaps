      "content": "Kippered is a downtown wine bar with a unique specialty: tinned fish. Lots of tinned fish in fact, with over 50 different cans on the menu. The tinned fish platters here are pretty fantastic—ask the passionate staff for suggestions and you'll be digging into Spanish octopus in olive oil with a pile of crackers, olives, good butter, and hot sauce. But if you aren't someone whose eyes light up at a freshly popped tin of sardines, you should head to this charming, dark wood-lined bar steps from Grand Central Market anyway. It's run by the same people behind DTLA Cheese, which means you can go to town on sheep's milk pecorino and aged gouda, which pair well with the nice selection of wines by the glass and draft beer (there's even a soft-rind cheese from France that's served with a glug of Champagne poured over the top). Drinking snacks don't get much better than this."

There are over 50 cans on the menu and the platters they come with are fantastic—ask the staff for suggestions and you'll be digging into Spanish octopus in olive oil with a pile of crackers, olives, good butter, and hot sauce. But even if you aren't someone who wakes up dreaming about preserved seafood, Kippered has a great selection of sparkling wines and cheeses as well, including a soft rind cheese from France served with a glug of Champagne poured over the top—if that doesn't pique your interest, we have nothing in common."

The wine selection is full of interesting European finds, including an excellent list of sparkling wines and decently priced Champagne by the glass. Make sure to try soft-rind French cheese served with a glug of bubbly poured over the top."

      "content": "This Downtown sparkling wine bar specializes in tinned fish, though the pair of owners—who also run nearby DTLA Cheese—aren't averse to mixing dairy and seafood in the same meal alongside the tightly curated list of bubbly by the glass. The compact space features a mirrored bar and mood lighting after dark, for those hoping to stare lovingly into someone else's eyes over some first-rate conservas."

      "content": "Tinned fish is certainly en vogue these days, and Kippered has taken advantage of the trend by pairing sparkling wines with over 50 different varieties of tinned fish. Add in a passionate staff, who are more than happy to advise you what bottle pairs best with octopus in olive oil, and you have one of the hippest wine bars in L.A. Run by the same people as DTLA Cheese, a popular local cheese shop, Kippered manages to be both bright and cozy, edgy yet classic. Located in Downtown L.A., just steps from Grand Central Market, there are two daily happy hours, 5 pm to 6 pm and a later 9 pm to 10 pm, which makes stopping by before or after dinner a more than worthwhile endeavor."
