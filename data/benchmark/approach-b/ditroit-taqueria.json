      "content": "You won't casually stumble upon Ditroit. The Arts District taco window is at the end of a walkway, concealed by a parking lot behind foreboding gates surrounded by bunch of dusty industrial lots. But if you're in the area and looking for a quick, standout lunch, head this way.\n\nDitroit is the breezy daytime operation behind Damian (from the chef of Pujol in Mexico City and Cosme and Atla in NYC), which means the causal food here is super elevated and leans pricey: a \"daily catch\" fish flauta, cochinita pibil taco, and a palo santo-cucumber-yuzu agua fresca will run you almost $30. But oof, it's good.\n\nThey nixtamalize their masa in-house, that cochinita pibil oozes with salacious, citrusy juices, and the suadero taco—with crispy-but-still juicy cubes of brisket and top round beef—is always on our minds.\n\nRating: Pretty Good. You'll likely be satisfied by a meal here, especially for a specific situation."

      "content": "This stylish backdoor taqueria in the Arts District serves gourmet tacos by way of chef Enrique Olvera, best known for Mexico City's Pujol and New York's Cosme. Though the tacos come at a premium, each one is made with the same delicate, housemade tortillas and fresh salsas served at its more upscale full-service sibling, Damian, for the kind of quality and freshness you can taste in every bite.\n\nI like the carnitas and suadero options well enough, but my favorite is the fish flauta, which features a rotating fish filling tucked into a crisp, extra-long rolled tortilla. Each one arrives dressed with crema, salsa verde, cabbage slaw and a sprinkling of cheese.\n\nMy advice? Skip the regular tacos and go for a flauta or tamal, then chase your meal with the churros con chocolate, a cup of soft-serve or one of the impeccably constructed fruity paletas."

      "content": "That first bite into Ditroit's fish flauta fresh out of the fryer makes a good case for why this semi-hidden Arts District spot is a destination lunch. The fish-filled cigar is piping hot, never greasy, and stuffed with plenty of fish. It's crucial that you design each bite with care. Squeeze a little lime down the hatch, proportion out the finely shaved onion and cabbage, drizzle a drop of crema, take a chomp, and repeat.\n\nDitroit is Damian's daytime alleyway taco window, and Damian is one of the Best Mexican Restaurants in LA because they're masa and fish savants. So you know this is no ordinary flauta."

This Arts District taco destination also offers a lush, greenery-filled alleyway to enjoy your meal.\n\nI like the carnitas and suadero options well enough, but my favorite is the fish flauta, which features a rotating fish filling tucked into a crisp, extra-long rolled tortilla.

Time Out tip: While the small lot fills up quickly, there's free parking for customers just off Violet."
