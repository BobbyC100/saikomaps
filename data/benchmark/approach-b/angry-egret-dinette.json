      "content": "Angry Egret is a torta and sandwich shop in Chinatown serving innovative food you need in your life. The sandwiches being sold out of the window at Angry Egret in Chinatown are some of the most interesting tortas being made in LA. The Torta Au Pied De Cochon involves pork shoulder rolled in a deboned pig's foot, served with habañero mustard - the ground pork patty is salty and tender, with just a bit of gaminess. There's also a (slightly) more traditional brisket sandwich, with avocado, queso fresco, and horseradish cream. No matter which torta you pick, be sure to add in a machaca flauta, a heavily spiced beef flauta topped with very spicy red and green salsas. The operation was started by Wes Avila, who founded Guerrilla Tacos, the food-car-turned-truck-turned-big-deal Arts District restaurant. In some ways, Angry Egret reminds me of the early(ish) days of Guerrilla, when they were a truck outside of Silverlake Wines - innovative and fun, sort of throwing things at a wall to see what sticks."

      "content": "The headliner is the Whittier Blvd ($13): beef belly braised in star anise-laced lard for eight hours, then stuffed on a roll with horseradish cream, avocado, queso fresco, serrano chile, and red pepper escabeche. It's hearty and decadent—especially if you opt to add a duck egg, which you should—but also perfectly balanced. Sandwiches with fried ingredients, like the Baja shrimp po'boy ($16, above) and a veggie number ($14) with Broccolini tempura, miraculously manage to remain crispy and travel well. The modest operation has outdoor seating for dozens, and Avila would love to eventually to do some \"dinette after dark\" specials, perhaps bringing in a spit and pizza oven to make al pastor pizzas. While he could have used his COVID time to relax, Avila says he's much happier to be back in the kitchen. \"I wanted to create again.\""
