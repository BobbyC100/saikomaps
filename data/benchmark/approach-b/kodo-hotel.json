      "content": "For all the activity and openings happening in downtown L.A.'s Arts District in the last decade or so, there have been almost no appealing options for places to stay smack dab in the area. There is Soho Warehouse, which opened in 2019 with 48 rooms available, but it's available only for Soho House members. Now, Kodō Hotel can put guests right in the center of all that the Arts District has to offer, from exploring galleries like Hauser & Wirth to eating at the Arts District's plethora of restaurants — including one great café that's right downstairs. The property's ground-floor Kodō restaurant serves everything from sushi rolls and omakase platters to salads and main dishes like Uni-mentaiko Cream Pasta with cured egg yolk. Kodō restaurant and hotel are located in a former fire station dating back to 1927. More dining options located nearby in the Arts District are Hauser & Wirth's Manuela restaurant, Korean-American Yangban (right next door to the hotel), French restaurant Camphor (which has one of the best burgers in L.A.), Mexican hotspot La Cha Cha Chá, chef Enrique Olvera's Damian, The Factory Kitchen and Baroo. Kodō Hotel is the brainchild of Boulevard Hospitality Group, which also owns the historic Japanese restaurant Yamashiro overlooking Hollywood, as well as such spots as Durango Cantina on Melrose and the three-level Cork & Batter in Inglewood. Boulevard recently launched Nice & Sweet, a new bakery and coffee shop in Hollywood, located at 7061 W. Sunset Boulevard. Minimalist nine-room boutique property Kodo Hotel is located inside a nearly 100-year-old former fire station and features a ground-floor Japanese cafe. The stunning nine-room Kodo Hotel is located inside a nearly 100-year-old former fire station and features a Japanese cafe on the ground floor. Add Kodō Hotel to the list of the best and most unique places to stay in Los Angeles. Modern, minimalist and boasting just nine rooms, the boutique hotel opened earlier this year in downtown L.A.'s Arts District along South Santa Fe Avenue just below 7th Street. Directly across the street from Warner Music Group's L.A. offices, Kodō Hotel is tucked away on the second floor of a former Beaux Arts-style fire station that dates back to 1927. Travel aficionados may recall that this spot had a brief life as another boutique hotel, the aptly named Firehouse Hotel, which enjoyed a brief run after opening in 2019, not far from such hotspot restaurants as Bestia and Bavel. Guests should be aware that the hotel does not have an elevator and the hotel rooms are reached only via a tall staircase. Rooms, starting at $218 a night, are available at kodohotel.com and booking.com."

      "content": "Splicing minimal wabi-sabi design with artistic flourishes, Kodo Hotel exudes urban LA cool — minus the static and thrum of downtown. This tranquil Arts District haven has just eight bedrooms, each with outsize custom concrete furnishings that contrast pillowy futon-style beds — its setting in a century-old former firehouse sprinkling a little period charm into the mix too. The Japanese restaurant downstairs is also hot property, drawing clued-up Angelenos for artful sushi, ceviche and sake cocktails. There's no formal dress code at Kodo, but Arts District locals lean towards statement-casual: opt for colors that pop against the hotel's minimalist backdrop and go big on accessories. Kodo is a magnet for in-the-know Angelenos, serving up Japanese-style wagyu steak and seafood cooked over binchotan charcoal in a sleek dining room of cool concrete banquettes, exposed red brick and artistically draped textiles. There's plenty of outdoor seating, including a greenhouse-style space that seats 20 around a titanic pine table for private dining. Order from the grill or sushi counter, or go all in on the chef's 12-course omakase experience. As a hotel guest, you get a free morning pastry and hot drink at the hotel's intimate café, set in the airy lobby area with its monolithic ornamental boulders, leafy plants, tatami benches and soaring windows (previously the firehouse doors) that overlook the street and Warner Music Group building opposite. The hotel's eight ryokan-style rooms each draw inspiration from nature, incorporating earthy palettes and tactile textures of wood and stone. Rooms are named according to the subtle individual design elements found within – Izumi (water), Koke (moss), Tsuki (moon), and so on – so that you could be forgiven for thinking you've been dropped in a Japanese zen garden, rather than into the beating (he)art of DTLA. Kodo Hotel served as a working LAFD engine house from 1927 until 1980, and retains many of its original features, including exposed red-brick walls and rafters and an imposing firehouse façade bearing the legend 'Engine Co. No. 17'."
