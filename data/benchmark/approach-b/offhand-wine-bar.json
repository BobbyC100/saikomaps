      "content": "This newer, Black-owned Santa Monica wine bar serves natural wine with a side of vinyl music on the weekends and relaxed neighborhood vibes. A little less buttoned up than Esters and more youthful than Wally's, Offhand also offers craft beers, natural sakes and wine cocktails alongside the usual list of pet-nat bottles and selection by the glass. Snack on bites like marinated olives, charcuterie boards and a killer grilled cheese sandwich with your glass of wine or two. Moreover, Offhand offers a stacked monthly calendar that includes regular DJs, visiting winemakers from around the globe and occasional food pop-ups."

      "content": "Then there's Offhand, the chill, just-sophisticated-enough antidote to all of the above. Sure, the building itself looks like it could be a Chipotle from the outside. But inside, they're spinning vinyl with super smooth transitions, pouring interesting natural stuff, and the lighting is just right. This is a great spot to meet up with friends or a date when you want to chit-chat, but also want to feel like you're out on the town. Come by for a drink and you'll probably stay for two. Offhand Wine Bar is the only natural wine place in Santa Monica where you can groove to vinyl DJ sets."

      "content": "When it comes to the demographics of people who hang out in Santa Monica wine bars, Wally's is typically tourists and sugar babies, Esters is a holding ground for hangry people waiting for their table at Cassia, and Bodega is 23-year-olds on dates. Then there's Offhand, the chill, sophisticated-enough antidote to all of the above. Sure, the building itself looks like it could be a Chipotle from the outside.
