      "content": "The name of this mysterious Montrose coffee shop might be a cliffhanger, but the answer is actually straightforward. How's it going to end? With a nice latte. Housed in an artfully converted former dry cleaning business, HIGTE is surrounded by an expansive desert patio that spills into a coffee shop that resembles a minimalist art installation, complete with a giant boulder in the middle of the room. It's the edgiest thing we've seen in this sleepy LA suburb, which is cool, but the coffee is a worthwhile attraction, too. The menu stays simple: well-executed espresso drinks, matcha, and unsweetened cream tops. Do you need to drive across town to see this place? Unless you're a Dwell diehard, maybe not. But a good coffee on their sunny patio is pleasant indeed."

The stylish, destination-worthy café seamlessly blends indoor and outdoor space and offers a small parking lot, plus plenty of street parking. Unlike most new coffee shops, HIGTE (as it's often abbreviated as) forgoes trendy, complicated drinks in favor of well-executed standards. Quiche and pastries from Friends & Family and Gooey Center Bakery round out HIGTE's food and drink offerings. Be sure to make a trip to the restroom: The couple have turned the space's old industrial-sized laundry vent in the ceiling into an art installation that glows bright red."
