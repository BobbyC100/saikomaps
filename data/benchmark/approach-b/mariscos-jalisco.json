      "content": "Raul Ortega holds a miniature Mariscos Jalisco food truck. Famed for tacos dorados de camarones — golden tacos filled with shrimp that emerge tender at the center and crisped on the edges after a dip in the fryer — the truck has been a part of every \"101 Best Restaurants in Los Angeles\" guide since 2013 under Times critics Bill Addison, Patricia Escárcega and the late Jonathan Gold.\n\nAddison has written that his serious eating for the annual 101 list always begins with a plate of Mariscos Jalisco's tacos dorados de camarones. \"The meal is a ritual,\" Addison said in 2022. \"Juicy salsa and sliced avocados douse the first blazing bites like liquid metal cooling a nuclear reactor.\"\n\n\"In some circles,\" Gold wrote in 2012, \"admitting that you live in Los Angeles but haven't visited Mariscos Jalisco is like confessing that you've never been to Dodger Stadium, or driven through the four-level freeway interchange, or eaten a corn dog on Muscle Beach — inexcusable, really.\"\n\nThese expressions of admiration for Mariscos Jalisco, and Ortega's influence in shaping a part of Los Angeles' culinary landscape with a single beloved taco, sync beautifully with the parameters set out by Gold when he gave Wolfgang Puck the first Gold Award during The Times' second Food Bowl festival in 2017. The key phrase: \"honoring culinary excellence and expanding the notion of what Southern California cooking might be.\"\n\nOrtega, who started Mariscos Jalisco as a lonchera, or stationary food truck, on Olympic Boulevard in 2002, has expanded his enterprise to two other L.A. locations and Pomona as well. He also added a simple indoor dining space (with bathrooms) steps from the original truck to make it easier to eat your tacos, aguachile plates and Poseidon tostadas stacked high with shrimp ceviche, octopus and red aguachile.\n\nEven with the stresses of a growing business as well as the challenges of the COVID pandemic and shifting city regulations plus rising food and labor prices, Ortega has maintained the high standards he set for the truck when he introduced the shrimp taco inspired by the ceviche style he and a taquero friend knew from their days in San Juan de los Lagos, Jalisco.\n\nA few years after his business was established on Olympic, a new wave of food trucks rose up, with Roy Choi's Kogi truck the most visible of the new style in 2008. Think of Mariscos Jalisco as a bridge between the classic taco trucks that roamed the city for decades and the trucks that emerged in the 2010s. Since that time, a new generation of trucks and stands run by young Mexican and Mexican American taqueros, many dispensing hyper-regional styles of cooking, has come to dominate the streets.\n\nThe 2024 Gold Award will be presented to Mariscos Jalisco's Raul Ortega during this year's Food Bowl festival at Paramount Studios on Sept. 20."

      "content": "Mariscos Jalisco has been serving East LA since long before food trucks had their own festivals inside football stadiums. Their formula is simple - quick service, affordable prices, and some of the freshest seafood you'll get in Los Angeles.\n\nMost people waiting in line are here for the taco de camaron: a perfectly deep-fried shell, stuffed with massive shrimp, topped with housemade red salsa and avocado. We can't think of a more consistently fantastic taco in the city.\n\nBut you don't get an 8.8 just for doing a shrimp taco right. Mariscos Jalisco's menu is stacked, and if you come here just for the taco de camaron, you're missing out. The poseidon tostada is essentially a four-inch-high pile of ceviche, octopus, and shrimp aguachile, and it's fantastic. If you want something simpler, get the aguachile on its own - this shrimp in a spicy red sauce is worth ordering just for the avocados that come on top.\n\nMost people just sit and eat along a nearby gray ledge, but if you're with a group or have a few minutes to kill, there are tables inside the building Mariscos is parked in front of. Speaking of its location - while it's not particularly hard to find, you do have to be on the lookout for similar trucks nearby with \"Mariscos\" also printed on the side. Jalisco is the one with the big stand-alone menu out front.\n\nCome to Mariscos Jalisco for the shrimp tacos, stay for the rest of the menu, and give your body over to the hysteria that follows. One of the most iconic dishes in LA, this glorious deep-fried shrimp taco is as great as it's ever been. We would travel across oceans to eat this thing, so let's all be thankful it's just off the 5.\n\nStacked with ceviche, octopus, and shrimp aguachile, all the seafood on this tostada is as fresh as it gets, and the red sauce on the aguachile gives it an excellent kick."

Today his Jalisco-inspired tacos have become a rite of passage, and he now runs a number of trucks around town, not to mention this modest but cherished spot in Pomona.\n\nThe menu is the same everywhere, limited to tostadas piled with various lime-kissed ceviches. Inside tip: opt for his signature fried shrimp taco tinged with spicy salsa and creamy avocado slices. It's an unequaled version, complete with a crunchy shell that collapses like tempura, as well as a rich and savory filling.\n\nFirst-time customers start with a single order, while regulars get right to business with a whole plate of them."

Their signature tacos dorado de camaron lives up to the hype with flavorful and fresh shrimp folded into a corn tortilla that is then fried to a golden brown and topped with thick slices of avocado and a vibrant and complex salsa roja. You'll also want to save room for their legendary tostadas like the Poseidon topped with shrimp ceviche, octopus and a fiery red aguachile of shrimp."

Now served at four locations across town, these crispy-fried tacos dorados are stuffed with a warm shrimp and potato filling, topped with avocado, then doused in fresh tomato salsa with flecks of cabbage mixed in. For seafood fans, the texture alone could warrant a trip across the country.\n\nBut Mariscos Jalisco isn't a one-hit wonder. We also love the Poseidon tostada, which comes heaped with finely minced Baja-style ceviche, cooked octopus, and a spicy red aguachile that acts as a fiery garnish."
