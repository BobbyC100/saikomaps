      "content": "Musso is a wonderfully bizarre place. The wood-paneled interior of Hollywood's oldest restaurant resembles a well-preserved Elks Lodge that hosts 300-person weddings, complete with dusty chandeliers and an out-of-use phone booth in the back. Its throwback American menu is filled with schmaltzy nostalgia, and the martini is more famous than anyone inside.\n\nOn its best nights, Musso's dining room is about 40% tourists and 60% regulars who've been drinking the same glass of Scotch since they won an Emmy for casting in 1982. Occasionally, the cargo shorts crowd packs in and turns the front dining room into a Raddison Inn lobby, so avoid that scene by calling day-of for a reservation. That's when Musso & Frank Grill offers up tables in its private dining rooms, and you'll end up with a semi-exclusive dinner with all of the other Angelenos who texted \"I'm in.\"\n\nPeople have been drinking perfectly stirred martinis at Musso since before Prohibition, so if you come asking for some souped-up twist based on a TikTok trend, you're going to be judged. By everyone.\n\nThe correct path forward is the $62, 12-ounce filet mignon, which is a good value in Hollywood, consistently tender, and always arrives on the pink side of medium rare. And if you need a second entree, the sanddabs drizzled in a sauce meunière is a worthy choice. From there, add one gooey onion soup au gratin per person and a side of Lyonnaise potatoes.\n\nNo one likes sharing good french onion soup, so just order a cup for every person at the table. Because this gooey, decadent version is great.\n\nMusso has six types of potatoes on their menu, and this is the best. The spuds are boiled and sliced, then shallow-fried in a giant pile with onions. If you can't finish them, take them home for excellent breakfast in the morning.\n\nA place like Musso & Frank should crush a shrimp cocktail, but this dish flops. The shrimp are small and sad, and the way-too-sweet cocktail sauce only makes things worse.\n\nThis needs to be the centerpiece of every meal at Musso, and some say its tastes best when you're seated in front of the flame-broiler station along the bar counter. There's nothing flashy or over the top about it. Just a quality, well-cooked steak.\n\nIs it the prettiest dish in the world? No. But it's three flaky, pan-fried fish filets covered in butter sauce and capers. It won't be on the table long.\n\nThere are better cheesecakes in LA, but if you're craving a classic, right-down-the-middle version after a long night of martinis and red meat, you won't be disappointed.\n\nYou'll be tempted to try one of the menu's retro curiosities, too. Do so at your own risk. The only \"wow\" of dishes like the dry flannel cake or marinated herring glopped in sour cream is that they haven't been sealed away in a Smithsonian exhibit.\n\nNo one comes to this 100-year-old restaurant to eat great food—or if they do, they shouldn't. You come to flirt with handsome waiters in red tuxedo jackets, drink cocktails that come with a sidecar, and bask in the glory of a room with more movie history than a storage closet at The Egyptian."

      "content": "Musso & Frank, one of LA's oldest and most recognizable restaurants, is officially reopening after a year-long hiatus on Thursday, May 6th. The Old Hollywood spot will be doing indoor dining with red booths and all, at 50% capacity per Orange Tier guidelines, with strict social distancing implementation and an assisted parking system in lieu of their old valet, according to Deadline.\n\nThat said, everything else is staying exactly the same. Which means we can all prepare for waiters in red jackets and bowties, massive plates of steak, that weird phone booth in the corner, and several rounds of the greatest martini on earth.\n\nWe recommend booking your reservation now, as weekend time slots are already filling up through June. If you need your steak-and-martini fix sooner than that, keep scrolling."

      "content": "Open since 1919, Musso & Frank Grill is Hollywood's oldest restaurant—and it more than lives up to its century-long iconography. This steak-and-cocktails joint on Hollywood Boulevard was once favored by the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Raymond Chandler and Orson Welles.\n\nThanks to TV shows and movies like Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood, Ocean's Eleven and Mad Men, it's practically an actor and star in its own right, and you might still spy a modern celebrity there today.\n\nAs such, you're not allowed to take photos of the dining room, though you're more than welcome to take pictures of your meal or tablemates.\n\nWith its obscure mid-century dishes—jellied consommé and grilled lamb kidneys, anyone?—and a litany of steakhouse classics, the menu can be quite daunting. And while I can't recommend Musso and Frank strictly for the food, the steaks are a foolproof choice here, as are the sanddabs a la meunière."

The history here is palpable, but you don't have to be a movie star to try their famed martini.\n\nThese beauties (gin is favored among the older crowd, vodka among the younger) are stirred, not shaken, and topped with two olives and only a splash of vermouth if requested. While the martini is served throughout the week, the steadfast crew here makes more than 800 on a Saturday night.\n\nIf you aren't already a martini drinker, Musso & Frank's version will make you an immediate convert.\n\nA Musso & Frank Grill martini is one of LA's signature cocktails, but there are plenty other variations that deserve a hat tip around town."
