      "content": "Esters Wine Shop is a bottle shop-wine bar hybrid that's great for happy hour, laidback dates, and seeking refuge from whatever tourist chaos is brewing on the Third Street Promenade. Whether you pluck a bottle off the wall (for retail price, plus a modest corkage fee) or choose one of the by-the-glass options, the staff always has lots of (helpful) opinions. We've also long been fans of Esters' impressive charcuterie spreads, but we like eating here even now that they've added \"Oyster Bar\" to its name. The $95 grand plateau is perfect for two people, with plump oysters from Canada and a delicious crudo dressed with peppery olive oil and saffron aioli. Everything happening here is high-quality, including sweet snapper dressed in peppery olive oil, and sliced scallops that are as soft as room-temperature butter."

      "content": "Esters in Santa Monica might be known as that place you drink at before eating at Cassia, but this wine bar very much stands on its own. And while everyone in Santa Monica is raving about the French/Asian fusion spot (ourselves included), we're here to tell you Esters is entirely worthwhile on its own. Like Cassia, Esters has an aesthetically stunning perimeter, but it's the massive interior and cool patio that proves it's much more than your average wine bar. To no one's surprise, the menu is a cheese lover's paradise. But with everything from charcuterie to lamb meatballs to a hearty grilled cheese sandwich that easily feeds a family of four, you won't be stranded with some brie and crackers either. Yes, it's a wine bar, but you can definitely sit down and have dinner as well. And you should. This is carbo-loaded, indulgent finger food to accompany all that wine you're drinking."

      "content": "When it comes to the demographics of people who hang out in Santa Monica wine bars, Wally's is typically tourists and sugar babies, Esters is a holding ground for hangry people waiting for their table at Cassia, and Bodega is 23-year-olds on dates. Then there's Offhand, the chill, sophisticated-enough antidote to all of the above."
