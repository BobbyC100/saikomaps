      "content": "Chainsaw's tiny Melrose Hill cafe is a quirky stop for excellent arepas, Venezuelan coffee, and one of the best pies in the city.\n\nOnce upon a time (2020, to be exact), Chainsaw was a pop-up famous for passionfruit icebox pies ordered through social media and picked up at an apartment. Now, the fun has moved to their brick-and-mortar in Melrose Hill, which is just as quirky in energy, and just as itsy-bitsy in size (expect a few makeshift stools and tables out front).\n\nThe main attraction is still the incredible pie—available by the slice or whole—but there's also a lot more happening than dessert. Stop by in the morning for a cafe quesillo latte laced with caramel or a freshly fried Venezuelan arepa stuffed like a mini Pac-Man with serrano ham and spicy red pepper sauce.\n\nAround lunch, expect to find us avoiding the Melrose traffic creep, eating a lazy solo meal of crackly pork collar milanesa with arugula salad, papas fritas dunked in tangy tamarind barbecue sauce, or the off-menu jamon beurre baguette.\n\nYou can stick around later for a vermouth float (for more elbow room, you'll have to wait until Chainsaw expands with their wine bar next door), but if you're heading back to work, grab an icebox pie to treat the office. We did, and we were treated like royalty for the week."
