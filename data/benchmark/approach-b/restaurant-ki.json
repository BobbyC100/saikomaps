      "content": "Getting to Ki requires a little navigation. This dozen-seat chef's counter, hidden behind Bar Sawa in a Little Tokyo office building, is accessible only by weaving through a series of doors, including one labeled \"employees only.\" The journey feels like a grown-up version of sneaking into a top-secret tree house, and it sets the mood for what you'll find once you arrive: modernist Korean cooking that's just as exciting to watch come together as it is to eat.\n\nA meal at Ki costs $300 per person, but even if the windowless dining room can feel a little stale, the overall dining experience flows like a seamless DJ set—one with no skippable tracks. The reworked traditional dishes keep you on your toes, while capturing the spirit of comforting Korean meals that usually happen over sizzling barbecue grills or big cauldrons of stew—and the generous pours of wine and sake don't hurt either.\n\nThe chef previously ran Kinn in Koreatown, and while the 12-course menu here is nearly twice the cost of that now-closed spot, it's also a clear level up in terms of flavor and ambition.\n\nCourse Breakdown:\n\nA strong first impression. The chefs introduce this course as a nod to kimbap that's made with tartare-like tuna and crispy bugak. It's a delicious single bite, and we immediately wanted another one.\n\nOne of the best courses, and even better than the famous octopus dish at Kinn. The octopus leg is charred and crisped so beautifully, you'll hear it before you taste it. You're instructed to give it a drizzle of lime juice and dunk it in the orange-hued sauce that's made from the octopus's head—a full-circle moment that we don't want to think too hard about.\n\nAnother standout. Velvety duck liver mousse is layered with white peach jelly, then topped with chunks of apple, cilantro stems, and tiny croutons. The best spoonfuls combine the rich mousse, tart jelly, and the crunchy garnishes—we scraped every inch of the shiny duck bowl clean.\n\nWe're suckers for shaved ice, and the one at Restaurant Ki offers a fun twist. The tart omija berry snow is served with a side of sweet milk jam dressed up with edible flowers for mixing and matching. The ladybug spoon is a cute touch, too.\n\nComparison & Rating:\n\nCompared to other splurgy tasting menus, Ki isn't the showiest experience, and the very plain room doesn't offer much—but it makes up for it in sheer originality and incredible food. Truly Excellent: An 8 should be on your must-try list, because 8s are great. These spots are worth making an effort or crossing town for.\n\nReservations are released on the first of every month at noon for the following month."

      "content": "With the same modern Korean flair as Atomix and Benu, chef Ki Kim has crafted Los Angeles' next great tasting menu. Restaurant Ki offers elegant, minimalist Korean fine dining in the same mold as NYC's world-class Atomix.\n\nBackground on Chef Ki Kim:\n\nThis is why I was never the biggest fan of Koreatown's now-closed Kinn, a wildly ambitious starter pack of a restaurant run by Ki Kim, a South Korea-born, Colorado-raised chef who cut his teeth cooking in Michelin-starred kitchens in New York City and San Francisco. In both cities' fine dining scenes, upscale modernist Korean cuisine has firmly taken root among more traditional Japanese and French interpretations—including several kitchens Kim has personally passed through.\n\nTo anyone remotely familiar with national food trends, the critically acclaimed Kinn was an obvious attempt to propagate that style of modern Korean fine dining in L.A. When Kim first opened Kinn in late 2021, the city had surprisingly few upscale, chef-driven interpretations of Korean cuisine. Starting at $72 for much of its run—rising to $95 later on once Kim folded the octopus supplement into the prix-fixe—the seemingly reasonable price point translated into food portions so dainty I always needed to eat a snack afterwards.\n\nAt the end of 2023, Kinn shut its doors just days shy of being included in the Times' 101 Best Restaurants, with Kim citing inconsistent business as well as severe burnout as reasons for the closure. After less than a year of working at two Michelin-starred Vespertine and Meteora (during which the latter also earned a star), Kim announced he was working on an independent project in partnership with Yoshiyuki Inoue, the chef-owner behind Sushi Kaneyoshi, one of the city's best sushi restaurants."

      "content": "Located in the same Little Tokyo complex as Sushi Kaneyoshi and Bar Sawa, the chef's new tasting experience ($285) is one of the most interesting, essential fine dining experiences in the city right now.\n\nAfter a nearly yearlong stint at Jordan Kahn's Vespertine and Meteora, chef Ki Kim is once again pushing the boundaries of modern Korean fine dining. Over a dozen rotating seafood-centric courses, Kim uses a mix of traditional Korean and classic French, fine-dining techniques to craft a uniquely L.A. Korean tasting menu experience rooted in farmer's market seasonality.\n\nSalmon roe and smoked tomatoes offset a delicate, verdant quenelle of perilla leaf sorbet in a bowl framed by an enormous dried leaf—a plate technique with a direct throughline to Kim's former employer, Jordan Kahn, who offers similar presentations at Vespertine and Meteora. The chef has also reconfigured his signature octopus dish as a tender two-bite dish paired with octopus head aioli and a sliver of local citrus.\n\nA $190 beverage pairing spanning wine, sake and tea, along with ultra-polished service, befits the high price point, but you can also opt for non-alcoholic options like clarified rhubarb juice with thyme syrup. While Restaurant Ki employs the usual culinary trappings of luxury, their deployment feels anything but perfunctory.\n\nFor the jet-setting gourmands among us, Restaurant Ki is a place that conceptually stands on its own two feet even as it pays homage to Atomix, Jungsik and Benu (all three being multiple Michelin-starred Korean restaurants where Kim has worked). As someone who first became acquainted with Kim's cooking through Naemo, a short-lived dosirak pop-up during quarantine, Restaurant Ki translates into a glorious culmination of the chef's growth, both personal and professional.\n\nWhen I first visited Restaurant Ki, I left convinced that the experience was a little too niche for the average L.A. diner, describing it as a \"worthy special-occasion eatery for those who enjoy Korean cuisine, rare seafood, fine dining or all of the above.\" My second visit, however, blew all my expectations out of the water, and that was after being forced to reschedule a month later due to Downtown's ICE-related curfew. Even with the reopening of Baroo and the (temporarily?) now-closed Yangban, L.A.'s upscale Korean dining scene still lacks the general recognition and popularity of Japanese, Italian and French counterparts. Restaurant Ki just might be the tipping point the city needs to change that—chef's tweezers and all."
