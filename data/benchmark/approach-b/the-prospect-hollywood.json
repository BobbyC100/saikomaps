      "content": "The idea of Hollywood may be synonymous with glamour, but nearly a hundred years after the so-called Golden Age, the actual place is a bit more complicated. The Prospect Hollywood, however, is a return to form: a 1939 Hollywood Regency building, rescued from an advanced state of disrepair by designer Martyn Lawrence Bullard and transformed into what is, beneath its retro styling and vintage furniture, a thoroughly contemporary boutique hotel.\n\nThe days of monochrome minimalist \"design hotels\" feel very remote indeed from within these sumptuous spaces, with their ultra-saturated colors, their bold graphics, and their touchable textures. The garden courtyard, with its fireplaces and fountains, is a delightful place for a cocktail, and surrounding it are the Prospect's 24 rooms. Individually they vary in style and layout, but all are similarly lavish and maximalist, right down to the Diptyque bath products and the Revival New York linens.\n\nIn the lobby lounge you'll find Tartine baked goods and La Vittoria coffee, as well as a full bar. And while there's no on-site restaurant, Hollywood comes amply supplied with places to eat — and NeueHouse, a members' club and co-working space from the Prospect's owners, is open to Prospect guests, and includes its own restaurant, The Table, with a view over Sunset Boulevard."
