      "content": "When it comes to eating in Los Angeles, there are a handful of prerequisite restaurants. They're the essential places you need to eat at first, before anywhere else. Places like Jitlada. And that's because this classic restaurant not only set the bar for LA Thai food, it's still an excellent place to eat—as long as you know how to navigate the colossal menu. Located in a Thai Town stripmall, Jitlada has been in operation since the early 1970s. It changed ownership a few times over the years, but it wasn't until a brother and sister team took over in 2006 that it became the institution that it is today. They took a once-straightforward menu full of standbys you could eat in plenty of other Thai spots, and expanded it to include regional dishes from their hometown of Pak Phanang in Southern Thailand, like pickled crab and dried catfish curry. Jitlada's menu is massive—profoundly so—and predominantly made up of recipes passed down through their family. If you've heard one thing about the food here, it's probably that it's spicy. And we're here to tell you the rumors are true—the majority of their 400-item menu packs a fiery vengeance you don't often find at restaurants. But if having to wipe your forehead a few times during dinner is the worst part of your day, you lead a good life. When it comes to the spicy dishes, the khua kling phat lung, a dry beef curry, and Taepo chicken curry are non-negotiables, and if you want something less-spicy on your table, the crispy catfish salad, the turmeric chicken wings, and yes, the pad thai, are all fantastic. But what is maybe the most legendary dish at Jitlada isn't even on the menu. The Jazz Burger is only served when Jazz, the owner/chef, feels like making one. Call ahead to see if today is your lucky day. Crowds get intense here at night, but the good news is their takeout situation is a well-oiled machine, and you should take advantage of it. For first-timers or anyone looking to soak in a little LA restaurant history, eating inside Jitlada's cozy, tchotchke-filled dining room is a required LA experience. And that beats struggling to get through Of Mice And Men any day. This needs to be the first thing that hits your table. The crunchy catfish itself is fantastic, but it's the fresh mangos underneath that take it to another level. Jitlada has several wing options, but the wings and fried rice combination is the way to go. It's basically just a massive plate of spicy turmeric fried rice with wings on top, and ideal for big groups. Definitely not the most takeout-friendly dish on Jitlada's menu, save this for the nights when you dine-in. The taste of the crab meat and their garlic sauce together is what we think about first in the morning. Truly Excellent: An 8 should be on your must-try list, because 8s are great. These spots are worth making an effort or crossing town for."

      "content": "You'll find Jitlada in a well-worn strip mall, but its loyal following is a testament to the lingering reputation of this long-standing Southern Thai institution. The setting even has a touch of Hollywood; next to their framed awards and reviews, find illustrations by the Simpsons creator (and Jitlada super-fan)—Matt Groening. The menu, split between Thai standards and a selection of southern specialties, is nothing shy of gargantuan, but certain dishes jump off the page. A zingy salad of crispy catfish and green papaya is a favorite, and don't miss unique offerings like the bubbling-hot Taepo chicken curry with and tender morning glory stems, rich with coconut milk and aromatic warm spices, or the enticing array of \"Spicy Thai Dipped Dishes.\""

With endless celebrity photos and \"best of\" lists on the walls, chef Jazz Singsanong's strip mall joint in Thai Town is one of the city's cult favorites. The crispy morning glory salad is an obligatory dish—a flavorful mix of crunchy, deep-fried Chinese watercress, plump shrimp, red onions, cilantro, red cabbage and bell peppers marinated in the spicy house dressing."

Choose your method of torture, as Chef Tui serves up the plate swimming in a molten curry or mint leaf sauce with a multitude of protein options from tofu to frog legs (both $16.50). True to its title as spiciest dish in Los Angeles, the challenge leaves you teary-eyed, light-headed and in for a night of insatiable heartburn. If you can lick your plate, the bill is waived and you've conquered the city's number one spice challenge."
