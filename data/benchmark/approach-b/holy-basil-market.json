      "content": "LA's profound scope of Thai restaurants is no secret. Places like Jitlada and Night + Market are among the most recognizable restaurant names in the city. Others, like Luv2Eat, Ruen Pair and Sapp Coffee Shop have cult followings that make K-Pop fans look like they're half-assing it. At times, it feels as if there couldn't possibly be room for more greatness. But when Holy Basil in Downtown LA came along, we've been reminded that there's always room for another place to shift the conversation. Everything about Holy Basil DTLA, a tiny takeout window inside a Downtown food court, is straightforward, particularly the menu. It's filled with pad thai, green curry, and tom yum soup—all things that can be found on plenty of Thai menus around town. But to eat at Holy Basil is like trying them for the first time. It's this complexity of flavor that once made us drop our fork after a single bite of drunken noodles and double-check our receipt to make sure we ordered the right thing. Compared to Holy Basil's second, more ambitious sit-down location in Atwater Village, the original window is a tight operation that's both unique and accessible: The casual environment that allows you to either pick up your food or quickly order at the window. Eventually, tables will inhabit the food court's shared space, but for now, this pandemic-born operation has kept things as streamlined as possible."

      "content": "Sequels that are better than the original are rare. That rule generally extends to movies, younger siblings, and restaurants—which makes the second location of Holy Basil especially impressive. The inventive Thai cooking at this Atwater Village expansion builds on the excitement of the original in every way. As long as, like the first spot, you don't mind sacrificing a few comforts. When Holy Basil's DTLA takeout window opened in 2021, we were immediately smitten with Wedchayan \"Deau\" Arpapornnopparat and Tongkamal \"Joy\" Yuon's amped-up takes on traditional Thai dishes, even if it meant eating out of paper cartons on wobbly chairs. Their Atwater Village space, accessible by a narrow alleyway, is an upgrade in terms of square footage, though not by much. A stainless steel counter fits just eight seats, all next to the open kitchen where woks sizzle and clang. At lunch, Holy Basil is walk-in only and relatively mellow, which makes it a great option for a leisurely midday meal. If it's your first visit though, come for dinner—even if there's no booze on the menu just yet. The restaurant saves its more ambitious specials for nighttime service, and you can make a reservation ahead of time, though many people don't. Sure, the alleyway might be crowded with walk-in hopefuls, and you might be given an outdoor table so close to the HomeState patio next door that a dude eating brisket tacos could lean over the fence and ask you about your crab fried rice. But any minor inconveniences evaporate once the dishes start to land. Besides, the quirks are what make this tiny, scrappy Thai restaurant such a thrill. We wouldn't want our shoebox any other way. Even with the tight quarters and a thumping hip-hop playlist, nobody here is getting too rowdy. Probably because the restaurant is still waiting on their beer and wine license. If you want something stronger than oat milk thai tea, cross the street for a glass of pet-nat at Baby Battista afterward. A recurring theme at Holy Basil involves familiar dishes flipped on their heads, which is the case with this riff on Thai steak salad. Thin slices of rare grilled steak are laid out carpaccio style, then showered with a salty-tart lime vinaigrette, roasted rice powder, and a big handful of roasted chile powder that's more fruity and earthy than spicy. This is Holy Basil's must-order seafood dish. Raw shrimp are neatly sliced so they lie flat, then are bathed in a tongue-zapping mixture of sour tomatillos, fragrant lime leaves, fish sauce, and lots of raw garlic—a.k.a. Mexican aguachile that went to finishing school in Isaan. You can add uni on top for $18, though it more than doubles the price of the original dish."

      "content": "If the Holy Basil in Santa Monica were just a carbon copy of the one in Atwater Village, we'd be thrilled. But the menu at their Westside location goes one step further, featuring wild seafood-leaning Thai dishes that you won't find anywhere else. Fried calamari arrives dusted in salted egg yolk that makes them taste like corn chips, velvety slices of beef are poached in ultra-concentrated boat noodle soup, and crispy noodles come smothered in gravy speckled with egg tofu and chewy squid jerky. But new dishes aside, this Holy Basil is still Holy Basil-ing. The utilitarian space, on the ground floor of a condo complex, is slightly chaotic, and if you're seated at the counter, you'll be close enough to the wok station to feel blasts of heat. Drinks are just thai tea and hibiscus spritzes for now. Still, prices are reasonable, the room is lively, and the staff don't miss a beat whether you're grabbing takeout pad kee mao or splitting a strip steak with thai basil chimichurri and some sticky rice panna cotta at a two-top. If this is what expansion of the Holy Basil Empire looks like, sign us up for more."

      "content": "Holy Basil's tiny sit-down spot in an Atwater Village alleyway is the rare sequel that's even better than the original. Wagyu grapow packs the same savory heat and crispy pork belly boasts the same potato-chip skin as at their DTLA takeout window, but its Atwater-exclusive dishes like wild shrimp agua chile and seared beef tataki steal the spotlight. Lunch service is relatively mellow, but plan on making a reservation for dinner: the dining room fills up fast and you'll usually find some fun nightly specials like crispy wonton nachos. Tight quarters aside, the Thai cooking here is so special we'd happily wolf it down in an actual shoebox."

      "content": "You've likely eaten these dishes before, but Holy Basil prepares them with bright and bold flavors that make them taste like you're eating them again for the first time. If you're looking for a good place to start, order the tom yum soup and some stir-fried noodles (plus beer or natural wine) and grab a table in the street-food-esque outdoor dining area. For a full sit-down experience, we much prefer their larger Atwater Village location, but for a quick and casual meal, the DTLA branch is great."
