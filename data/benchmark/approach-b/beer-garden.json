Hidden behind a building right at the Echo Park end of Sunset, this casual, weekends-only spot has good German food, beer brewed downstairs, and one of the most spectacular (and roomiest) patios you'll find in Los Angeles. The restaurant is entirely outdoors, in an enormous space with tables under dappled shade—or a striped awning during cooler months—and a local crowd running the gamut from dates to hourslong friend hangs to quick dinners with the kids in tow. Pretzels, potato noodles, and a moon-sized pork schnitzel are all ordered from a window, but you can flag down a server once you're settled in for a second round of slushie spritzes. There's a work-in-progress feel to the whole operation, from the hours (they're currently open Fridays starting at 4pm, and at noon on Saturday to Sunday, but check before [content ends abruptly in source])."
