      "content": "Unless dropping $30 on an unremarkable lobster roll is your idea of a good time, there's no reason to visit this converted gas station on Beverly Blvd. Is the lobster roll decent? Sure, but we couldn't pick it out of a lineup if we tried. The most offensive items at Royal Lobster, however, are the sides—a handful of stale chips right out of a bag and coleslaw so watery we thought it was a small cup of milk. There's also a $30 lobster salad on the menu which, judging on lobster meat alone, tastes fine. The issue is the bed of wilted spring greens underneath that looks straight from Ralph's."
