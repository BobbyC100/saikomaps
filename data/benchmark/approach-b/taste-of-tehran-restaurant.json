      "content": "Taste of Tehran in Westwood is one of the best spots in town for quick, affordable Iranian food. Koobideh is a minced meat kabob dish that can be found on menus throughout West LA, but our favorite is the one served at Taste of Tehran. This tiny, order-at-the-counter shop marinates all their kabobs to complete perfection. They're juicy and tender, while still maintaining a small crunch every time you bite into one, courtesy of the grated onion inside. While the meats are a priority here (their citrusy cornish hen kabob is another standout), we also recommend getting involved with the dips. The mast-o-mousir, which is strained yogurt mixed with chopped shallots, is tangy, sour, and thick. We usually order one for the meal itself and then another for the road to spread on everything else we eat throughout the week."

      "content": "Why we love it: I've sampled kebabs of all stripes from over a dozen L.A. restaurants, and while other places offer more opulent ambience—or, in the case of Saffy's, cool-kid vibes—the main focus at Taste of Tehran speaks for itself. Served with rice and a grilled tomato, cuts like beef and chicken koobideh (ground meat kebabs) always come juicy, well-marinated and perfectly seasoned, with just the right amount of onion. Best of all, Saghar Fanisalek's fast-casual eatery is relatively affordable. Time Out tip: On Wednesdays and Thursdays, pairs can share the generously portioned Tehran plate special, which combines beef koobideh, chicken and filet mignon shish kebab and full plates of rice and salad. Address: 1915 Westwood Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90025"

      "content": "Cornish Hen ($14), a tiny chicken that my father ate pretty often when I was a kid, enjoys an overnight marinade in yogurt, saffron, onion, salt, pepper and more, resulting in juicy parts that build winning chars on Taste of Tehran's grill. Cornish game hen is a notably luscious Taste of Tehran special. A prominent chef I interviewed refuses to order from the specials board, convinced it's the provenance of tired ingredients and untested dishes. There are certainly places that would follow those unseemly practices, but I'm convinced some restaurants are serving specials that are actually special. Case in point: Taste of Tehran, a bare bones Persian restaurant with blonde wood tables and benches that debuted in July, 2013. Saghar Fanisalek, who attended Le Cordon Bleu and worked up Westwood Boulevard at Shaherzad for about a decade, helped craft the menu, and Roshan runs front of house. Specials on the board by the register might not all be available, but order them if possible. This specials board features savory stews, braised meats, and of course kebabs, which if you're lucky will include Cornish Hen. Each entrée at the Los Angeles restaurant comes with a grilled tomato, a sizable pile of fluffy saffron-stained basmati rice, and a salad with tangy house dressing made with yogurt, mayo and dill. Hopefully the Persian powers that be in back keep Cornish hen on the board, and hopefully it's actually available, since I definitely plan to order the bird again."
