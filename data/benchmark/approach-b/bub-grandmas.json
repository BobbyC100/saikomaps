      "content": "If you've ever ordered anything bread-related from a place in LA with cutesy menu fonts and small-batch coffee, chances are you're familiar with Bub & Grandma's. The loaves from this wholesale bakery have a rightfully devout following—from weekly lines at the farmers market filled with people waiting for subtly tangy sesame loaves to a client list of over 100 restaurants, cafes, and coffee shops stretching from Pasadena to Venice. Bub & Grandma's is everywhere. But they've never had a dedicated epicenter for serving other items beyond bread, until now.\n\nThe Bub & Grandma's cafe in Glassell Park is an homage to the early-morning American diner, complete with cushy white booths and a wrap-around bar looking into the kitchen. Open from 8am-4pm, it's a great place to grab some pastries, a sandwich, and a quick cup of coffee while mentally preparing for the day ahead.\n\nThis means two separate menus and—in a play ripped right from the McDonald's handbook—once breakfast is over, it's over (no matter how nicely you ask the cashier at the counter). That leaves everybody with a big choice, one we're happy to assist with: go for breakfast.\n\nThe early morning hours are when Bub & Grandma's is at its best. Lines at the order-at-the-counter space are short, fragrant plumes of that fresh bread smell waft from the ovens, and the daily pastry case is stocked and ready to be raided. It's also when you're able to order the breakfast sandwich—our favorite thing on the menu and absolutely one of the best versions we've eaten in LA. There's not much to the sandwich—just some eggs, a slice of American, mayo, and ketchup on a plump kaiser roll—but it's a simple case of fresh, well-executed ingredients layered in perfect ratios. We can't speak for everyone, but sitting at B&G's white marble counter with that sandwich, a plate of pastries, and a warm loaf of bread wrapped for the ride home is the only way we like being seen in public at 8am.\n\nThis isn't to say lunch should be avoided, of course. If post-11am is when you can get to Bub & Grandma's, you'll be treated to an expanded menu of 10 or so sandwiches (including some excellent vegetarian options), various sides, and a chunky potato salad we'd go to battle to protect. The place also becomes more lively (read: more crowded) around lunch, so we recommend skipping the line inside and ordering from the takeout window instead. Here you'll get the same exact menu, but the food comes out faster, and there are plenty of tables on the sidewalk.\n\nNow, if you're one of those people who base their personality on spreadsheets or are particularly good at raking in airline points, you're probably already scheming a way to get both breakfast and lunch in one sitting. We're here to tell you it's possible—and pretty easy. Arrive at 10:30am, order breakfast inside, wait for 11am, and then swing by the takeout window on your way out for all the to-go sandwiches you want."

      "content": "Since 2015, Bub and Grandma's amazing bread has captured the hearts (and stomachs) of diners at some of L.A.'s finest restaurants, but baker Andy Kadin's plan all along was a sandwich shop inspired by NYC tristate delis. His dream is now realized at this sunny daytime Glassell Park eatery serving all the manner of heavenly sandwiches, side salads and pastries. The passion fruit doughnut is a dream, as is the banana cream pie, but you shouldn't leave here without trying at least one sandwich. (We like the vegan-friendly Rainbow, which mixes curried tofu, pickled vegetables, avocado and tahini spread.) Most Sunday and Monday evenings, Bub's also hosts BG Nights, which features a slightly larger, still sandwich-centric dinner menu and live jazz."

      "content": "There was a time when bread in Los Angeles was a failed notion, an appetite killer offered to occupy our attention while the kitchen fiddled with the meal that was the point of the visit. It came with a rectangle of butter-like substance that, in theory, made the bread a tad more palatable. Restaurant bread and butter was Muzak for the mouth, bland and barely noticeable. And then…the world changed. Nancy Silverton opened her La Brea Bakery, moving Los Angeles from Wonder Bread to Parisian baguettes. Hans Rockenwagner gave up on sit-down for grab-and-go. Locals became obsessed with pastry from Lodge Bread, Clark Street, Gjusta…and on the Eastside, Bub and Grandma's, the creation of advertising copywriter Andy Kadin, who got his start getting up at 4 am to bake in his home oven.\n\nMerrill Shindler has spent his life eating for a living in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. His idea of happiness is a seat at the counter at Bub and Grandma's, watching joyous chaos of the kitchen, with a beef and pork meatloaf on challah in hand.\n\nThe B&G Restaurant is a noisy, rambunctious space, with booths and a counter that offers a show worthy of The Bear. Orders are hollered, demands are made, servers scurry, platters plop down. Show up before 11 in the morning, and there are eggs and cheese on kaiser rolls, biscuits & gravy, and toast with butter and jam…or butter and anchovies! Starting at 10, there are sandwiches; at 11, salads as well. Good salads, served in wooden bowls, with tuna, curried tofu or chicken, ham or turkey. But B&G is about its bread. And that means its sandwiches. And those sandwiches are a wonder to behold.\n\nThey are also done the way the kitchen at B&G wants to do them. I asked if I could have the braised brisket with apple mostarda on challah rather than the \"Bub Sub\" that's on the menu."

The highly regarded bread baker held a soft opening over the Labor Day holiday in a bright and airy space on Eagle Rock Boulevard. There was social media chatter saying that the place could officially open as soon as today, Sept. 8, but a notice at one point on Bub and Grandma's website said Sept. 12. Expect breakfast sandwiches, like Chorizo, egg & cheese, and lunch sandos, including a vegan Cauliflower Cheddar, in addition to salads, pastries and, yes, bread."
