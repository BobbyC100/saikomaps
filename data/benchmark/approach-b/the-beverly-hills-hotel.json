      "content": "Welcome to the 'Hotel California'. Looking just as dreamy half a century later, the legendary pink spires of the Beverly Hills Hotel were immortalised on the cover of the Eagles' best-selling 1976 album of the same name, peeking out from behind hazy palm tree fronds in a twinkling, twilight-lit photo. Still the first port of call for the biggest names in film and music, The Beverly Hills Hotel is a celebrity in its own right. As well as its starring role on the 'Hotel California' album cover, photographer Slim Aarons' took a number of glamorous shots of the picture-perfect property and its pool in the 1950s, helping to seal the mythology of one of L.A.'s most historic hotels. It remains impressively chic; the old school, country club-styled salmon-pink exterior largely untouched. As such, it remains a go-to for the Hollywood set (we end up having to change our booking date due to an Emmys party taking over the entire hotel). But parties or not, at the Beverly Hills Hotel a celebrity encounter in the lobby is pretty much guaranteed. To walk in the footsteps of icons. To stay at the storied Beverly Hills Hotel is to do as Hollywood royalty has done since the hotel opened in 1912, the first major property to be built in the dusty, largely untouched area of Beverly Hills. At first, it attracted silent movie era stars, from Buster Keaton to Charlie Chaplin, as well as Gloria Swanson, who took up residence in one of the hotel's stand-alone bungalows while getting her divorce. By the 1950s it was known as a luxury destination, with the Rat Pack and Marilyn Monroe regulars in the bungalows, much like Elizabeth Taylor who spent six of her eight honeymoons in them. If that sounds like good company, then the Beverly Hills Hotel is for you. The main hotel has 210 rooms and suites, while out back are the bungalows, 23 exclusive homes linked by winding pathways lined with sub-tropical plants and with direct, private access from the road. Find your room in the main building down corridors clad in the hotel's semi-psychedelic green palm on pink print. You've probably seen the pool already. That iconic photo of Faye Dunaway, the morning after the Academy Awards slumped in a chair with a cigarette in hand and her Oscar on the table? The pool behind her is the one at The Beverly Hills Hotel. It's very good-looking, flanked by pink and candy-striped green loungers, with sunshades adorned with their palm print and real life palm trees all around. There's a hot tub too, as well as high-end private cabanas with televisions—one of them is where composer Leonard Bernstein came up with the idea for West Side Story. How Hollywood is the pool? On our visit, a glam couple were accompanied by their pet cat on a leash, and staff didn't bat an eyelid. There's also a windowless fitness center if you fancy a proper workout, and a world-famous spa."

      "content": "Michelin, the authority on all things restaurants, is now getting into the hotel game. Starting this year, the organization is giving out Michelin Keys, the equivalent of its culinary stars albeit directed at a city's most exciting hotels. This year's debut picks include two properties in Los Angeles that we are oh-so-proud of (even if we can't exactly afford to stay at them): the Beverly Hills Hotel and Hotel Bel-Air. To be precise, the duo received three Michelin Keys each, an honor bestowed to only 11 properties across the U.S. As with its restaurant recognition program, the awards range from one to three Keys; three calls out \"extraordinary stays\" that are all about indulgence and top-notch hospitality. As mentioned in the release, the Beverly Hills Hotel on Sunset Boulevard has been synonymous with Hollywood glamour since first opening back in 1912. Often referred to \"the Pink Palace\" given its now-legendary exterior color, the destination is also home to a number of restaurants that famous guests like the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, John Lennon and Frank Sinatra have dined at throughout the years: the Polo Lounge, Cabana Cafe, Bar Nineteen12 and the Fountain Coffee room."

      "content": "The Beverly Hills Hotel is a shining beacon of pastel pink luring tourists and their cameras, but while we recommend you stay far away from The Polo Lounge (the restaurant with the lowest rating in Infatuation history), the downstairs Fountain Coffee Room is another story. This 19-stool counter feels like someone dropped an old-school diner in the middle of a fancy Beverly Hills hotel. The crowd is a mix of whichever TV star is in-house on a press tour, European tourists celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary, and local rich ladies popping in for their regular breakfast of half a grapefruit and the silver dollar pancakes. Sure, the food isn't anything particularly special (and comes at Beverly Hills prices), but for a fun breakfast in the area, this place can't be beat. The Fountain Coffee Room is a classic morning counter service spot in the Beverly Hills Hotel."

      "content": "Los Angeles is a town where looks matter. In no other city will you find fake-magic anti-aging juices with a religious following, more fillers in the average actor/personal trainer's face than should be legal, and Saturday mornings devoted entirely to hiking in designer clothes. While there are many restaurant examples of this very true stereotype, none are as lacking in substance as The Polo Lounge. This is a pretty place full of people who only care about being seen, and full of food no person should ever have to eat. At this restaurant inside The Beverly Hills Hotel, appearance is all that matters - whether you're sat at the right table, with the right people, and can get a photo to prove that you were here. There's pink everywhere, a very retro sign out front, and a lot of fern wallpaper. The crowd is Hollywood people and wannabe Hollywood people who've ended up here for a meeting with a film executive who can determine the rest of their career (but are actually just looking for a). The Polo Lounge seems like one of those classic Old Hollywood spots, but the food and the scene are awful. There are better places for star sightings. The Polo Lounge is everything your friend from New York City who refuses to step foot in Los Angeles hates. Sure, you're on a sunny, beautiful patio surrounded by beautiful people, but from the uninterested service to the overpriced food, it's hard not to feel instantly depressed. If you're looking for a classic Hollywood scene that's actually enjoyable, go to Chateau Marmont. At least you won't leave there miserable, hungry, and broke."
