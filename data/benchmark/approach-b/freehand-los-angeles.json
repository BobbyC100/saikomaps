      "content": "We're not saying Miami and Chicago were warm-up acts, necessarily. They're big cities, and major destinations in their own right. But Los Angeles is the big stage — and when a mini-chain like Freehand chooses downtown L.A. as a location for its third hotel, the anticipation tends to run high. Follow the enormous neon \"Commercial Exchange\" sign — at 12 stories, the largest in the city — to a historic, renovated office building, once the home of Edgar Rice Burroughs's publishing company. There's a suite named after him on the top floor of the building with unbeatable panoramic views of DTLA. (If you're looking for something smaller and cozier, stay in a king room, studio, or suite. You'll still have great views, and you can take in the full panorama from the rooftop pool.) Bringing a group of friends or a big family? Try the shared rooms with bunk beds — trust us, they offer a lot more privacy than your college dorm room ever did. But no matter the room you choose, the decor here is homey and very L.A.: Roman & Williams outfitted these generous guestrooms with dark woods and cream walls, big windows with plenty of light, and Angeleno artwork hanging on the walls. The Freehand team worked to make their newest property the full L.A. experience, but they made an exception by bringing along the Broken Shaker cocktail bar that's become beloved in Miami and Chicago (and racked up a few prizes as well, including a James Beard Award finalist spot). Combined with the buzz building around the hotel restaurant, The Exchange, named for that neon sign and featuring food from local chef Alex Chang, we expect you'll find a lot of locals hanging around — and that's always a good sign."

      "content": "Catering to a hip international crowd, this buzzy hotel lives up to its hype with homey accommodations, killer cuisine and shared dorms to ensure that even true bohemians can get a room. Located in the heart of downtown LA's financial district, this relatively new boutique hotel gives Downtown's more established hip hotels some serious competition. The Freehand's lobby is done up in a cheeky '70s palette of mustard and violet, complimented by rustic wooden furniture. Inside the rooms you'll find that same updated boho aesthetic, with bespoke details like woven wall hangings, stacks of art books and wallpaper crafted from vintage maps of the city. The Freehand also offers four dining options, including a tea room, an Israeli-California fusion restaurant and the standout rooftop Broken Shaker bar. Time Out tip: Don't sleep on Flowerboy, the Freehand's gift shop. In lieu of the usual dad caps and license plate keychains, this boutique offers fresh cut floral arrangements, art objects, vintage clothing and more. Even if you can't fit a succulent into your carry-on, you're sure to find a unique souvenir. The pool itself is laden with millennial-friendly inflatables and offers a surprisingly relaxed experience; while the bar attracts twenty-somethings from across the city, the pool is open to hotel guests only. What makes the Freehand truly special, though, is that to stay there, you don't have to break the bank: dorm-style shared rooms can house four, six, or eight travelers for a fraction of the price of a suite. Bonus: given the cool factor of the Freehand's crowd, your bunkmate just might be your next adventure partner. Location: Bars, shops, restaurants and galleries are all within walking distance of the Freehand's Downtown LA location; if you can't find what you need nearby, the metro will take transport you to a variety of LA hot spots from Pasadena to the Santa Monica Pier."

      "content": "Broken Shaker is the rooftop bar at Freehand Hotel downtown with great views and good enough cocktails to make up for its aggressive scene. The rooftop bar at the Freehand Hotel took all of about five seconds to attract that aggressively predictable models and bottles crowd on the weekends, but on weekdays, the place remains fairly low-key. Drinks aren't cheap, but you're paying for great views and a pool area you could hang out all night in. If you're looking to impress an out-of-town client, Broken Shaker is where you need to be."
