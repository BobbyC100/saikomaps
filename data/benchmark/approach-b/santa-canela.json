      "content": "If you've been to Loreto, the fancy Mexican seafood restaurant in Frogtown, you know that the best part of the meal often comes during dessert. If not, don't feel left out. Now you can go to Santa Canela.\n\nThe modest-sized Mexican bakery in Highland Park is run by Loreto's pastry chef and specializes in pan dulce, \"LA\"-shaped churros, and focaccia sandwiches stacked with cured beef and kale chimichurri. We're already big fans of the crunchy house conchas dusted in cinnamon and piped with vanilla chantilly, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nLines are long on the weekends, so get there before 11am or risk someone grabbing the last strawberry-chile doughnut from the shelves.\n\nAfterward, take your box of pastries and go for a neighborhood walk—the order counter bottlenecks quickly, so don't plan on hanging around.\n\nIf you don't have a dollop of cream filling on your nose after biting into this crunchy three-inch-tall concha, you're not taking big enough bites.\n\nOutside of the namesake concha, this caramel-filled kouign amann is our favorite pastry at Santa Canela. The flaky burnished edges act as a barrier for the pool of cajeta in the middle. After one bite, the sticky caramel sauce pours out like water gushing from Shasta Dam.\n\nA croissant that tastes like a Disneyland churro except softer (and cheaper)? Make sure it ends up in your pastry box.\n\nPastries are the priority at Santa Canela, but the coffee just about as good. The menu changes daily, but just know that, whether it's a café de olla or an iced burnt cinnamon latte, these are strong, not-too-sweet drinks that'll glue your eyes open until dinner."

The selection spans fresh \"LA\"-shaped churros, exquisite strawberry-chile donuts, focaccia sandwiches, and our favorite, the crunchy house conchas dusted in cinnamon and filled vanilla chantilly, which tastes even better than they look (and that's saying something). Lines form on weekends, so arrive before 11am when some items sell out. The order counter bottlenecks easily, so plan on taking your pastry box to-go and walking the neighborhood afterward."

      "content": "Highland Park's vibrant restaurant scene just got a new contender in the form of Santa Canela, a Mexican bakery and coffee shop serving up modern and upscale twists on classic panaderia fare.\n\nFounder and pastry chef Ellen Ramos got her start in the DTLA restaurant scene, famously serving LA-shaped churros at Cha Cha Cha before moving onto other fine dining destinations downtown like Redbird. At Santa Canela, Ramos embraces her Mexican and El Salvadoran roots alongside her childhood memories in El Sereno with pastries inspired by the panaderias of LA and Mexico City.\n\nOfferings vary by day and include both sweet and savory delights, like potato soyrizo croissants, chicken tinga tarts, and sandwiches on house-made focaccia. You can see what's being baked for the day as you wait for your latte or caffe de olla, among other traditional drinks served at Mexican bakeries with a modern twist.\n\nSanta Canela is located on 5601 North Figueroa Street in Highland Park and is open from 9AM to 4PM Wednesday through Sunday.\n\nSanta Canela's small storefront in Highland Park is near the Metro A station and built on the site of a former bank. Repurposed bank buildings are excellent for modern bakeries because old vaults can fit ovens!"
