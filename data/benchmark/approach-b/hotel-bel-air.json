      "content": "Tucked away in one of Beverly Hills' most exclusive hillside neighborhoods, this is the kind of hotel you'll never want to leave, with sprawling verdant grounds, and airy, ultra private-feeling rooms. The main part of the estate was built back in the 1920s as the planning office for the newly-minted Bel-Air locale, and converted into a hotel in the 1940s. It remains a paragon of old Hollywood glamour, and you'll feel like you're in your own little world in this secluded retreat halfway up one of L.A.'s many hidden canyons. Grace Kelly loved it so much there's a suite named after her, and it's also where Marilyn Monroe staged her last ever photoshoot. Warning: don't book the Hotel Bel-Air if this is your first trip to L.A., as you'll struggle to see anything else the city has to offer. A proper hideaway, the Bel-Air Hotel was made as a private sanctuary. The dusty pink-painted mission-style property features 60 acres of gorgeously landscaped gardens, with over 1,200 different types of plants, from jasmine to fruit trees as well as the stunning purple lonchocarpus tree that drapes itself wantonly over the hotel restaurant's al fresco terrace. There's also a hidden grotto with ducks, a lake with swans and a redwood grove, plus modern art—sculptures by Michael Wilding Jr (aka Elizabeth Taylor's son) pepper the lobby and on the exterior pathways that link together the hotel's various outbuildings. A mid-size hotel with cozy, boutique energy, there are 103 rooms here, including 45 suites. No two rooms are alike, but are all modern, with midcentury-styled furniture that harks back to classic Hollywood."

Landing at number 35, the destination is also home to a spa and wellness center, a gym and the high-end Restaurant at Hotel Bel-Air. Just a few months ago, Hotel Bel-Air and its iconic sister property, the Beverly Hills Hotel, received Michelin's most prestigious new awards: Michelin Keys, the equivalent of the organization's culinary stars, albeit directed at a city's most exciting hotels. The 103-room property has a long history of luring an array of well-heeled visitors from around the globe, from locals looking for a weekend staycation to low-key travelers from abroad who flock to the resort in the summer months for an unparalleled escape."

This is one of the city's most luxurious hotel properties, nestled in a Bel-Air canyon that couldn't possibly be ten minutes from the 405. A night here is not cheap, so we like to just cozy up to the bar and just pretend we're staying all week. The Art Deco space opens daily at 3pm and features comfy sitting areas, a roaring fireplace (even in the summer), and the opportunity to feel as rich as you want."

      "content": "Built in 1946 in a style that can only be described as romantic Mediterranean, the Hotel Bel-Air, with its rose-colored mission-style bungalows, is about as elite a hideaway as you can find. Hidden by bougainvillea, ficus, orange blossom, and fern, on eighteen acres right in the middle of LA's most exclusive suburb, the grounds are mapped by terracotta passageways, and the reception area lies just beyond an arched stone bridge. Naturally it was the Hollywood set who made it famous. Elizabeth Taylor honeymooned here with her first husband, Marilyn Monroe spent a lot of time hopping between rooms 133 and 33, and legend has it that Lauren Bacall flooded the hotel during the Academy Awards. Although the hotel has undergone extensive renovations, it still feels like a Hollywood hideaway from the golden age. Celebrities are not known for the judiciousness of their requests, and the Bel-Air's staff is legendary for their ability to do anything. Most Bel-Air guests come here for a break from the spotlight; nonetheless, the very public restaurant is always busy, and for good reason. The food at the Bel-Air is fantastic. Even the notoriously ill-tempered swans eat well here — on romaine lettuce leaves. The non-feathered guests rave about the lemon pancakes, the tortilla soup, and the hot water pipes underneath the terracotta floor of the restaurant patio, to warm the feet of anyone dining outside. Make sure you do, because the Bel-Air is about scents. The aroma of freesia, gardenia and rosemary from the on-site herb garden is divine, and for many, what characterizes the hotel at its luxurious best is the smell of the avocado wood burning in the fireplace at the bar."

      "content": "Through the neoclassical gates that welcome visitors to this most exclusive of LA neighborhoods, down winding roads lined with megamansions, the Hotel Bel-Air spreads out like a storybook estate, complete with a small lake and its swans. In June, a guest's first steps into the hotel, over a covered stone footbridge, is scented by jasmines in bloom. Natural beauty, in the secret courtyards and towering redwoods, is prized here. Many of the 58 rooms and 45 suites spread throughout the Hotel Bel-Air front gardens. The Presidential Suite, at over 2,200 square feet the self-styled largest suite in Los Angeles, is the pièce de résistance. Often booked out for weeks at a time, the Spanish-tiled space has a dining table with room for 10 and a private pool bigger than that of many other entire hotels. Other suites come with their own built-in legacies, like the luxe one named for Grace Kelly, which holds an electronic archive of letters that she penned there. The hotel's main restaurant is an al fresco oasis, set beneath a pergola and crowded with bougainvillea. Spacious alcoves around the perimeter are highly sought after for private affairs. The menu here is California cuisine inspired by Culinary Director Joe Garcia's twice-a-week trips to the farmers market, with cocktails that pull from the fragrant fruit trees around the acreage. The Bar & Lounge is a dapper after-hours with live music nightly and an impressive collection of Japanese whiskey. And the newly opened Pâtisserie has become a fast favorite of Bel Air neighbors, who stop in for a croissant and an espresso at the European-styled café."

The sprawling property, set within the confines of the mansion-strewn neighborhood of Bel-Air, features rose-colored bungalows, swan-filled ponds and lush landscaping — a timeless elegance in an exclusive location that continues to attract Hollywood luminaries. Visitors enjoy a garden paradise with private patios, gorgeous pool, spa, and several restaurants and bars from which to revel in the Southern California good life, well away from prying eyes. If the Bel-Air is for privacy, the Beverly Hills Hotel — with its iconic Polo Lounge restaurant — is where celebrities go to see and be seen."
