      "content": "The crew behind Thunderbird, Blind Donkey, and Verdugo Bar spent the last year gutting the former Moon Room/the Griffin space in Atwater Village. Now they're days away from introducing their latest bar, the High Low, a casual, cozy addition to the walkable bar options on this stretch of Los Feliz Boulevard starting February 9. Partners John Bower, Justin Farmer, Brandon Bradford, Joe Curran and John Condo acquired the building a year ago. With the help of Bower's wife, Jessica, they rehabbed it into a 1970s-inspired den with big leather banquettes, orange pendant lights, and a big room, plus a handful of TVs, Tex-Mex food, rotating local beers and of course, cocktails. When it comes to food, High Low's is similar to its sister Crosstown bar, Thunderbird. Arizona-born Farmer will bring his Tex-Mex-style tacos, nachos, queso and puffy burgers. Cocktails are simple with an emphasis on fresh juices. Try King Pine with Sazerac Rye, Lemon, Simple Syrup, Pineapple Gum Syrup, and Aquafaba. And in a fitting invention, the disco inferno cocktail includes Verde Momento mezcal, lemon, agave, aquafaba, and a floating sprinkle of chilli and sea salt. Pricing and hours are clear: well drinks $8, house cocktails $12, drafts $5–$10, a daily happy hour featuring $6 wells and discounts on select drafts and house cocktails, and opening hours starting next Wednesday from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m., with weekend brunch to be added as the staff gets their opening sea legs."
