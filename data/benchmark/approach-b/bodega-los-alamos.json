      "content": "Bodega is one of those places you see on social media and assume can't possibly look as gorgeous in real life. But somehow this outdoor wine garden is even more stunning in person. There are fire pits, hammocks, bocce ball courts, and a full greenhouse where you can buy succulents. Consider it an essential stop on any respectable wine crawl— just make sure it's the last of the day. Once you're in a hammock next to a roaring fire with a chilled red in hand, you aren't going anywhere for a while. Bonus: on Saturdays and Sundays, Priedite BBQ pops up on the far back patio.\n\nUnrated: This is a restaurant we want to re-visit before rating, or it's a coffee shop, bar, or dessert shop. We only rate spots where you can eat a full meal."
