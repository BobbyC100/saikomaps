      "content": "If you work remotely, you've probably gone to Highly Likely for laptop loitering. Their new location in Highland Park draws the same Carhartt beanie crowd to an exceedingly pleasant all-day cafe.\n\nThe place kind of looks like an upgraded WeWork with its excessive foliage and open floor plan, and it turns into quite the scene by 10am. You can take advantage of the free wifi here, but there's a strict laptop-free policy after 5pm.\n\nThat's when the counter-service cafe flips into a sit-down dinner spot with dishes like a classic pappardelle bolognese, chicken schnitzel, or a juicy steak done au poivre with Sichuan peppercorns (plus, most of the entrees cost around $20).\n\nThe massive space on Figueroa also has one of the best backyard patios in the neighborhood, where you can sit with a fig negroni and pretend you're in a secret garden behind an artist's studio."

      "content": "The second location of Highly Likely offers something a little something for everyone, plus a beautiful patio filled with olive trees, greenery and an outdoor bar. As with the West Adams original, it's a neighborhood coffee shop with delicious grain bowls, salads and other all-day fare, plus a fully loaded espresso, tea, beer and natural wine (just know there are no laptops allowed after 5pm).\n\nDuring the day, the U-shaped indoor bar is a haven for local remote workers. The most popular takeout items are the schnitzel, the gigante beans in yuzu broth and the matcha latte—do what you will with this information.\n\nUnlike the original Highly Likely, however, the Highland Park location stays open until 10pm, when the space transforms into a mood-lit dinner spot perfect for casual date nights and get-togethers. After dark, snack on tasty dishes like koji chicken schnitzel, crispy brown rice salad and harissa meatballs."

      "content": "Highland Park is the perfect pick for Highly Likely's second location. It's a neighborhood that apparently loves an all-day cafe (there are at least five others along Figueroa), and also needs more reasonably priced places to eat pasta with friends. The space kind of resembles an upgraded WeWork with its excessive foliage and open floor plan, and the laptop crowd dominates until 5pm. That's when the counter-service cafe flips into a sit-down dinner spot with dishes like pappardelle bolognese and mushroom piccata. This Highly Likely is also home to a truly outstanding backyard patio where you can sit with a fig negroni and pretend you're in a secret garden behind an artist's studio."
