      "content": "This small restaurant is located off the main streets of Chinatown, so it doesn't get as much traffic as it really deserves even though it's one of Chinatown's best. Jade Wok has that typically large menu found at many older Chinese restaurants, but what keeps us coming back here is the house special tofu, a silky slab of lightly fried, homemade tofu that's submerged in a mushroom and pork sauce–it's labeled on the menu simply as \"homemade bean curd (best tofu in town).\" To balance things out, we also like the tea-smoked duck and bite-sized Shanghai spare ribs, glazed with a sweet and sour sauce, which are good to share with the whole table. On top of the good food, most of Jade Wok's dishes are under $10, meaning you can try a lot without spending a ton. The modest dining room can fill up at lunchtime, so just make sure to plan ahead if you come by in the afternoon.\n\nIf Buffalo has chicken wings, then Shanghai has sweet and sour ribs. The Shanghai-style spare ribs are cut into perfect bite-sized pieces and coated in a sweet, sticky sauce. Chow down on the whole plate by yourself with some white rice for a meaty lunch, or share them as an appetizer with your table. Either way, you'll see why the spare ribs are the second most popular dish at Jade Wok."

      "content": "Blink and you might miss Jade Wok's awning on College Street. But in the dining room inside, you'll find a simple red and jade green dining room where everyone orders the same thing: house special tofu. On the menu, it's listed described as \"the best tofu in town\" and it's hard to disagree. Fat slabs of tofu are silky and deep-fried, bathing in a luxurious, rich sauce made from mushrooms and pork. Balance your meal with a few sides, like the tea-smoked duck or Shanghai spare ribs which come in bite-size pieces and glazed in a wonderful sweet and sour sauce."

      "content": "With a cozy Christmas-colored dining room and relatively sleepy closing time of 8:30pm, Jade Wok is the epitome of a Chinatown locals' spot, but the house special tofu and affordable menu prices have put it on the radar of food-loving Angelenos everywhere. The housemade tofu comes in a thick, meaty gravy topped with scallions, and takeout classics like chow fun, deep-fried pork chops and sweet-and-sour chicken are faithfully executed. Other must-try dishes include the Shanghai spare ribs, chicken wings and Sichuan-style eggplant."
