Deliver same-day in greater Los Angeles and San Fernando Valley (West to Calabasas, East to El Monte, North to Sylmar and South to Torrance), 365 days a year. Option to order via WineHotline (phone or text) or through the website. The wines they carry at the very least use organic grapes and have no added chemicals during the winemaking process. In addition, the wines are a combination of any of the following: biodynamic, dry-farmed, sustainably-farmed, unfined, unfiltered and hand-harvested."
