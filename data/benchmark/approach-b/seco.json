      "content": "The apartment-sized space looks like what the algorithm spits out when you type \"scene-y natural wine bar in Europe\" with its bespoke wooden stools, green tiles behind the counter, and a big distressed mirror along the wall (even the bread and butter is served on a mirror, for some reason). The room has a bubbly energy as it fills up with creative directors who part-time in Lisbon and people who own at least one crystal, but don't expect the same excitement from the snacky menu. Dishes veer from solid (hamachi crudo with brown butter) to generic (a slightly overdressed endive caesar) to underwhelming (oil-dripping pork adobada tostadas)—none of it worth planning a proper dinner around. The short list of mostly French natural wines works for a quick drink, but if your priorities are a great meal over being seen, there are better options in the neighborhood.\n\nSure, the words \"hamachi crudo\" show up on more menus these days than \"modifications politely declined,\" but the version at Seco—dressed with rich brown butter, yuzu ponzu, and little flecks of lime zest—is one of the restaurant's best dishes. A perfectly fine, slightly overdressed caesar. The salty little fishies draped on top are a nice touch, but you've likely had a more flavorful version of this salad elsewhere. You're told this is a signature dish, but it tastes more like a special at Qdoba. The tostada is stale, the marinated pork drips with oil but lacks flavor, and the whole thing falls apart after you manage to snap off a bite. This simple vodka pasta with breadcrumbs and parmesan is the largest of the small plates at Seco. It's a filling option if you're set on a full meal, but otherwise, there's nothing memorable going on."

      "content": "Favored by bicoastal elites and influencers (both wannabe and bonafide), this oh-so-trendy Silver Lake wine bar spills out onto the sidewalk nightly with people who want to LARP a night out in New York City. I'm not joking in the slightest—and honestly, I'd love to hate Seco if the food and wine offerings weren't actually good. Fortunately, they are. The 25-seat space, which recently debuted its daytime café menu, serves a series of flavorful small plates alongside natural wines by the glass that don't taste like vinegar (for once). Culinary highlights include the bluefin tuna tostada and endive Caesar salad, but the reason you should come to Seco is the scene and the scene alone. Expect to be jostled and packed in like a sardine for your glass of vino—the price of being cool these days, I suppose."

      "content": "With its prime Sunset Junction location and subtly sexy vibes, Seco Silverlake has swiftly taken the lead as the Eastside's hang du jour. The café by day and wine bar by night, which opened in late August, is operated by the Mexico City-based Santō Group, the same team behind the eponymous (and equally buzzy) sushi restaurant next door. Jos Gozain (the only Los Angeles-based partner at Santō) runs point, with an assist from a handful of key players who have altogether shaped Seco Silverlake into one of the buzziest destinations of the season. Those additional players: Travel influencer turned creative director Olivia Lopez oversaw everything from the styling of the space to the curation of dishware and decor. The chef is Dave Potes, formerly of Brooklyn's Okonomi. And Kae Whalen, an alum of Kismet and Bar Chelou, is behind the wine list.\n\nThe vibe at Seco Silverlake is best described as a blend of European café culture and Mexican hospitality. \"We tried to create an 'everyday bar' — like when you're walking in Europe and you find this cute little corner and you just sit there all day, drinking wine, having tapas, and just enjoying yourself,\" says Gozain. That languid attitude carries over to Silver Lake as well. Gozain's grandmother owned a Lebanese restaurant in Mexico, so he was raised in a hospitality family. There's a loose, easygoing nature to Seco Silverlake that those who've spent time in certain parts of Paris and Mexico City will find familiar.\n\n\"There's a saying in Mexico that doesn't exist here: sobremesa,\" says Gozain. \"It means that you go to a restaurant for dinner, but you stay there for hours. You're having the time of your life, drinking, ordering more, [just hanging], and that's not common in the U.S. Here, you go to a restaurant, you have an hour and a half, and then the check is brought and you're out,\" he says. \"That's completely the opposite of what we're trying to do.\"\n\nSeco Silverlake is located in the heart of Silver Lake, on a bustling stretch of Sunset Boulevard. Drive by on a Friday night, and you'll see crowds of young, fashionable Eastsiders pouring out onto the sidewalk. \"It's become a thing,\" says Gozain. \"We were not expecting what's happening, but it seems like people were craving this so much.\" Although the space is small, with only 35 seats inside and on the patio combined, the restaurant is welcoming in hundreds of guests on weekend nights. Potes' menu was formed from constraints. The kitchen has no hood, and no live fire. Wine bar staples like oysters, olives, and jamon and cheese plates set the tone, followed by crudos, tostadas, and a wild card spicy vodka strozzapreti. \"It's a funky menu, and it's also really easy [to execute],\" says Gozain. \"We love to free-style different cuisines, and our favorites are Japanese and Mexican.\" The top sellers so far are the pasta, a hamachi crudo with yuzu ponzu and brown butter, the endive Caesar salad (accented with toasted panko and nori powder), and burrata with ikura and truffle oil."

      "content": "Silver Lake's modern sushi spot Santo opened its sister restaurant Barr Seco in late August. Both restaurants are located on Sunset Boulevard between Hyperion and Lucille Avenues across from Pazzo Gelato and a block away from the now-closed Bar Moruno and Causita. The all-day spot blends Latino and Asian flavors, with a morning menu of coffee, various bowls, and sandwiches before transitioning to snackier dishes and natural wines in the evening. Jos Gozain, who opened the original Santo in Mexico City in 2021, partnered with The Art of Travel podcast host Olivia Lopez for Barr Seco. The two recruited New York chef David Potes (formerly of Okonomi in Brooklyn) to develop Barr Seco's day-to-night menu. Daytime offerings are available starting September 22 and include a matcha yogurt bowl, tomato miso soup, and a spicy tuna salad bocadillo sandwich.\n\nAfter 5 p.m., Potes assembles plates of marinated almonds, charcuterie, and oysters with a yuzu ponzu mignonette. Heartier dishes also appear on the dinner menu, like a scallop crudo with tomatillo, an adobo-marinated pork tostada, and spicy vodka strozzapreti pasta. Former Kismet sommelier Kae Whalen curated Barr Seco's natural wine list with by-the-glass options ranging from $14 to $17. Barr Seco's lived-in neighborhood feel comes from architect Lena Kohl. Similar to her work at La Cha Cha Chá, Loreto, and Maizano, Kohl customized the interior design with the custom bar, banquette, and cabinets. Lopez sourced and commissioned LA and Mexican artists to fill the space with custom plates from LA- and Mexico City-based studio Ananas Ananas, tables from LA furniture designer Michael Felix, glassware from Highland Park designer Valerie Quant, and plateware from 1050 Grados in Oaxaca.
