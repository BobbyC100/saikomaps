      "content": "Mamie is breezy Italian cafe in West Hollywood with very solid focaccia sandwiches. Stuffing a big focaccia sandwich in your face is easier now than ever, thanks to places like Tre Mani, Lorenzo California, and All'Antico Vinaio. Mamie is contributing to the cause, particularly if you live or work near West Hollywood. This breezy, counter-service cafe at Fairfax and Santa Monica offers thick Roman-style pizza slices, various cold case salads, and paninis worth prioritizing. They're made with imported meats and cheeses on crunchy, buttery focaccia that crackles with every chomp. Choosing one of the 18 sandwiches on the menu (including six vegetarian options) might give you vertigo, but we'd suggest the Monaco with tuna and Calabrian chiles, or the Cardinal with turkey, roasted tomato, melted comté, and artichoke cream. 7900 Santa Monica Blvd, West Hollywood, California 90046. Rating: Pretty Good: You'll likely be satisfied by a meal here, especially for a specific situation."

      "content": "Focaccia—or if you want to get technical, schiacciata—sandwiches are all the rage in L.A. right now, and very few match the consistency, excellence and daily availability of chef-owner Mikael Choukroun's relatively new Italian sandwich shop at the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue. All of the bread is made fresh daily, with new loaves coming out of the oven every two hours. High-quality ingredients run the gamut from classic cured meats like guanciale and mortadella to flavorful chunks of tuna conserva and herbed goat cheese. It's worth the pit stop (and a fairly tricky parking situation) to pick up one of these hefty sandwiches, which run in the $17 to $27 price range but are easily split among two diners. You can also put half into the fridge for dinner or lunch the next day. My favorite item is the Viale Di Parma, which consists of prosciutto di parma, fig jam, creamy gorgonzola, baby arugula and chopped pistachios."

      "content": "Mamie Italian Kitchen, which opened in June 2024, brought its own take on schiacciata, introducing high-end Italian ingredients to a boutique West Hollywood setting. Then came All'Antico Vinaio, which arrived in LA in September 2023, first opening on the westside in Venice before expanding to Koreatown in April 2024 and Beverly Hills in 2025. While it wasn't the first to introduce authentic Italian sandwiches to the city, its reputation and fan base from Florence amplified the movement, drawing massive lines and reinforcing LA's appetite for simple, high-quality Italian food."
