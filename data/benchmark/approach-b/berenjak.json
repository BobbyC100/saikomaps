      "content": "Getting a primetime table at Berenjak right now might be harder than getting an actual membership at Soho House. Hidden inside the private members club's Arts District location but open to the public, this Persian restaurant from London stands out for its dramatic setting. There's a lush garden patio lined with olive trees and a dining room barely lit with flickering, half-melted candles, which look pulled from a Drake album cover. Once your eyes adjust—we've visited caves with better lighting—expect to find people scanning the scene to see who else is there drinking saffron carajillos.\n\nThe Persian food here isn't groundbreaking, but order correctly and you're in for an enjoyable night, and one that's worth putting on a sharp outfit for a sexy dinner with friends. The starters tend to be strongest dishes, so kick off dinner with an order of warm taftoon bread that arrives inflated like a balloon, along with a handful of dips and salads, including tangy mast-o masir.\n\nWe do wish Berenjak's ghormeh sabzi better showcased the deep flavors of Persian stews, especially for $32, or that the basic house rice included tahdig, rather than just a sprinkle of crispy rice bits. That said, the char-grilled kebobs are a highlight, namely the chenjeh kabob with chunks of juicy lamb so tender they practically slip off their metal skewer. We'll be back soon to try more of the menu—including the Persian-style prix fixe menu—just as soon as we snag a reservation that isn't past our bedtime."

      "content": "This upscale Persian concept from London takes the standard kebab house formula—dips, skewers, stews, rice, bread—and elevates it with winning details, including two kinds of housemade bread and light citrus dressing on the panir sabzi (or cheese and herb platter). Since opening the first Berenjak in London back in 2018, chef Kian Samyani has expanded to Qatar (Doha), the UAE (Dubai, Sharjah) and NYC, but the glitzy, wide-reaching expansions have seemingly done little to detract from the flavorful, beautifully presented platters of kebabs and gleaming silver plates carrying mast-o-musir (shallot-topped creamy yogurt), salad olivieh (a Persian spin on Russian salad olivier) and hashk-e bademjan (roasted eggplant and whey dip).\n\nAn equally interesting beverage menu includes a clarified, boozy take on doogh, a classic Persian savory yogurt drink; a refreshing vodka watermelon cocktail playfully named \"shumpine\"; and a Persian-style black lime soda known as sharbat. While the L.A. outpost isn't the first Berenjak in the US, it's the first one that's available to the public. This is some of the best, if not necessarily the most interesting, Persian cuisine I've had in Los Angeles; and that's coming from someone who's been to essentially every major sit-down Persian restaurant in the county twice over."

      "content": "London's Berenjak has made its way to Los Angeles. The Michelin Bib Gourmand-winning contemporary Iranian restaurant opened in downtown L.A.'s Arts District's Soho Warehouse on Sept. 24, but they gave us a sneak peek days before. \"Berenjak was created to fill a gap,\" explained Kian Samyani, the restaurant's founder and chef. \"It's Persian food through my lens and how I like to eat it at home. Our concept isn't created around kebab and rice. It's more to do with kebab and bread and how I enjoy eating kebab, and especially how I enjoyed eating it when I used to go to Tehran when I was little.\"\n\nSamyani said he used to go back to Tehran every year to see his family and friends, which left him with \"vivid memories\" of going to hole-in-the-wall establishments, which inspired Berenjak's concept. \"You'd go inside, you'd place your order, you'd get a big tray of like bread, you'd go outside, you'd get a ticket, you'd go out onto the street, and you'd give this man your ticket. He'd cook your kebabs on the grill. He'd lift your lavash bread, he'd put it inside and pull out the skewers and then send you on your way. And it's those kinds of romantic memories of kebab with bread that I wanted to replicate at the restaurant.\"\n\nSince opening in London in 2018, Berenjak has evolved, explained manager Julia Kaniewska. \"I think we opened the door for a new kind of Iranian restaurant that people wanted. They were hungry for an Iranian concept that wasn't the same as a traditional Iranian restaurant,\" Samyani said.\n\nThe Los Angeles location has a combination of a beautiful outdoor space where guests can dine in a garden-like atmosphere, or head inside for a vibe of dark lights, candlelight and loud music. \"The restaurant really comes alive at night when it's full, and it feels so amazing when it's dark here,\" Kaniewska said. \"It's got this beautiful balance of a really intimate indoor space with that dim lighting, and then the outdoor space with a garden and really making the most of L.A.\""
