This semi-hidden walk-up window—located within the literal loading dock of a warehouse—is one of the Arts District's best affordable lunch options, so don't be deterred by the lack of signage (or limited patio seating). Around noon you'll find a line of construction workers and security guards ordering bagfuls of hard shells stuffed with shredded beef, grated yellow cheese, and pickled onions, plus maybe a chorizo and bean burrito or two. Join them and make sure to ask for extra green salsa. Pretty Good: You'll likely be satisfied by a meal here, especially for a specific situation. These are handy back-up restaurants and beloved local spots. Garrett is a lifelong Californian who's covered the LA dining scene as a writer/editor since 2012."
