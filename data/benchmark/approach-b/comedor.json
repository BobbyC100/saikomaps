      "content": "A slightly more casual resurrection of Broken Spanish—Ray Garcia's new-wave Mexican restaurant that closed in 2020—Comedor has a lot going for it: a bumping Latin-funk playlist, sultry lighting that makes the lofted A-frame space glow, and small plates that are actually priced like small plates. You don't need to count the couples sharing enchiladas at this Westside spot to realize its potential for an under-the-radar date night. Despite pea guacamole on the tostada and salt foam capping the margarita, the food here is decidedly homey. Smoked tuna adds oomph to a cheese-stuffed flauta, and sweet potatoes come smothered in salsa macha butter with a surprising kick. Don't skip the crispy chicharrón in garlicky mojo, a Broken Spanish holdover that stayed on our mind (and breath) long after dessert."

      "content": "Housed within the short-lived Best Bet space, Broken Spanish Comedor is the triumphant revival of Garcia's signature \"authentically inauthentic\" Mexican restaurant. Unlike the Downtown original, the bulk of Broken Spanish Comedor's menu consists of more accessibly priced dishes in the $15 to $22 range. The additional name modifier nods to Mexico's classic comedores: small, typically mom-and-pop restaurants and street stalls serving homestyle cuisine. During my meal, I loved the pesto-like fideo flavored with avocado and hoja santa and classic enchiladas verde inspired by Garcia's childhood meals. The critically acclaimed Mexican American chef has also brought back a handful of signature dishes, including the refried lentils (an earthy, flavorful mashup between dal and traditional refried beans) and the must-try crispy, crackly chicharrón in garlic mojo, which comes with a beautiful red cabbage slaw and a fiery salsa morita."

      "content": "Native Angeleno chef Ray Garcia has revived his original downtown LA Modern Mexican concept, Broken Spanish, which closed in 2020, into a new space on Washington Boulevard in Culver City. Why we love it: It's great to have Garcia back on the westside serving some of the original Broken Spanish classics, along with a good salt air margarita. Comedor translates loosely to dining room or a place to eat together, which became a key part of the concept. As such, the studio focused on warm neutrals and comfortable earth tones, seen in laser-cut breezeblock-style wood panels and curved ceiling light pendants wrapped in gauzy linen. Garcia brings back his beloved chicharrón entrée (which can take five days to make), utilising crispy pork belly and pickled red cabbage, along with his albóndigas made with duck meatballs, bacon, and nopales, plus a rendition of chicken enchiladas with feta in green tomatillo salsa."
