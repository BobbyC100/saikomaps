      "content": "One Star: High quality cooking\n\nA note of elegant simplicity pervades the experience at this minimalist eight-seat counter, overseen by Chef Nozomi Mori and her streamlined, adroitly hospitable team. The unassuming space and soft-spoken service serve as a backdrop for an artfully prepared omakase that highlights purity and refinement. The lack of superfluous embellishment puts the spotlight on exceptional seafood (flown in several times a week from Japan) accented by seasonal produce from the Santa Monica farmer's market.\n\nBeginning with a perfectly silky chawanmushi with gingko nut, attention to detail sets the meal apart, spanning the exquisitely intricate knifework and finely tuned shari in a piece of squid nigiri, through to the matcha skillfully prepared by Chef Mori in a graceful final flourish."

      "content": "Elegance and elements of Japanese tea ceremony distinguish this new female-run high-end sushi restaurant in the former Mori Sushi space.\n\nInside, the minimalist dining room is largely unchanged aside from a stunning floral arrangement on a glass-and-concrete accent table set off from the eight-seat sushi bar. It's a familiar enough scene for anyone well-acquainted with L.A. omakase joints, save for one immediately noticeable fact: Head chef Nozomi Mori is female, and so is the rest of her small staff. Having tried 48 different omakases in Los Angeles, plus the city's high-profile kaiseki restaurants, I can count on one hand how many times I've been handed a piece of nigiri made by a woman. The predominantly male world of highly skilled sushi chefs, or itamae, has long discriminated against women for myriad reasons, including a widely held false belief that the average female core body temperature adversely affects how women handle raw fish. Of course, like all aspects of patriarchy, this idea is utter nonsense, but the end result remains—walking out of my first visit to Mori Nozomi earlier this spring, I was struck by how refreshingly different the high-end sushi experience felt for me when everyone involved in creating it is female.\n\nDespite the chef's relatively young age and her having less than a decade of formal training (Mori has also worked at West Hollywood's Sushi Ginza Onodera and Moto Azabu in Marina del Rey), I would say Mori Nozomi already holds its own against other standard-bearing edomae-style sushi spots like Morihiro and Sushi Kaneyoshi. Right now, there is simply nothing else like this in Los Angeles, and not only because the chef is a woman.\n\nThe vibe: Minimalist and elegant, but feel free to come casually dressed—this is the Westside, and rich people often dress like slobs.\nThe food: 15 to 17 unique courses including appetizers, cooked seafood and nigiri, plus seasonal fruit and Mori's subtly sweet handmade wagashi.\nThe drink: A high-end sake bottle list, plus a more limited selection of sake by the glass, hot green tea, as well a $55 tea pairing.\n\nTime Out tip: Have a particular date in mind? Set your alarm—Tock reservations for Mori Nozomi are released at midnight on a 30-day rolling basis."

      "content": "Here's an easier way to remember it: Mori Nozomi is one of the few high-end sushi spots in LA with a female head chef and kitchen staff—a rarity in the male-dominated sushi world.\n\nExpect plenty of fancy sushi standbys, too: chu-toro, golden snapper, and plump curls of Hokkaido uni. Our lone quibble is the pacing of the meal slows to a drip between certain courses, though the warm and generous service makes up for it (the elegant red bean mochi and matcha you're presented at the meal's end are nice touches). While we might not suggest it as a first stop for the omakase newbie, Mori Nozomi is a strong addition to the city's luxury sushi roster that should be on any serious sushi fan's checklist.\n\nReservations for the following week are released every Sunday at 10am. Book around then and you'll generally find a slot available, or just keep an eye open for week-of cancellations."

      "content": "Nozomi Mori opened her eponymous omakase restaurant in March with a simple premise. She planned to source top-quality fish and serve her favorite cuts of sushi for guests with the utmost hospitality. She had orchestrated her space—a spare, serene room tucked behind closed doors on a bright corner of Sawtelle—so that an eight-seat counter would be the anchor. From behind it, she would welcome one seating per night, at 7 p.m., Tuesday through Saturday. Being a woman in the deeply male-dominated field of sushi wasn't something that Mori thought much about. She hired an all-female team, a mix of culinary and front-of-house talent—including a sous chef, Yuko, who formerly worked in pastry at Eleven Madison Park—to help prepare her omakase and service guests.\n\nMori was born in Hyōgo, a port city just west of Osaka. She grew up eating sushi alongside other Japanese foods, but it wasn't her love for the cuisine, or even for fish, that drew her to become a sushi chef. \"I'm more of a meat person,\" she says, laughing. \"I like steak and barbecue.\" Rather, she fell in love with the experience of serving guests from behind a sushi counter. Mori began her career in Tokyo, working as a store clerk for luxury fashion brands, including Gucci and Issey Miyake, where she learned how to artfully present expensive clothing and cater to the desires of wealthy clients.\n\nToday, in Los Angeles, however, Mori has been welcomed with open arms. Prominent members of the food media have come in to dine. Big-name chefs have taken a seat at her counter. The quirky Michelin-starred chef Shusaku Toba, who has eight restaurants in Tokyo, flew in from Japan to collaborate with Mori on a dinner. And on a recent Sunday, when the restaurant was supposed to be closed, she opened at the request of a handful of L.A.'s most acclaimed sushi chefs—from places like Sushi Kaneyoshi, Shunji, and Kogane—who altogether came in for omakase.\n\nShe added that although she didn't understand her gender to be remarkable back in March, she's found a calling as a role model for women who aspire to be sushi chefs. Now seven months into operating her omakase restaurant, Mori has been most surprised by her clientele and the ripple effect of their response. \"Some nights, we have all female customers,\" she says. \"Usually at high-end sushi restaurants, it's couples [celebrating] anniversaries or something special, but I have so many female customers. And they all tell me that they want to support me. I feel very [welcomed] in Los Angeles.\""
