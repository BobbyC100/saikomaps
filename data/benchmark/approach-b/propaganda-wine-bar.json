      "content": "The Arts District hardly lacks for solid Italian fare, but this neighborhood wine bar manages to carve out a unique space for itself with some of the best pinsas in Los Angeles. Featuring digs that suggest a higher price point, Propaganda offers a completely shareable, affordable menu full of cheese plates and pinsa, it's a prime spot to impress dates or a couple of friends. Trading the area's standard industrial look for a mid-century Mediterranean mash-up, both the main dining room and patio feel cozy and intimate. Wine connoisseurs and novices alike can appreciate the lack of pretension and the gentle guidance of knowledgeable staff. In addition to a strong natural wine program, a few rotating spritzes (currently including the buzzy negroni sbagliato) dot the menu. Depending on your mood, Propaganda could be the main attraction of the night, or you could start your evening with their aperitivo happy hour and then dine elsewhere."

      "content": "I'm happy to report that Foodie Friend #3 and I found the selection of seafood that fit in tiny cans at Propaganda Wine Bar impressive and very satisfying. Mussels in escabeche marinade, octopus in seasoned oil, sardines, anchovies and tuna, of course, all heaped atop crostini smeared with snooty European butter. But wait, there's more! Propaganda also does divine Italian-influenced charcuteries and cheeses and inspired pizzas, plus a well-curated selection of organic wines. Okay, we didn't try everything, but we were sold on the whole tapas presentation and funky-cool ambience. And we felt very hip and happening because we were out after dark downtown in the Arts District. A win-win if I ever saw one. Logistical note: Visit Hauser & Wirth Gallery down the street and make it that much artsier!"
