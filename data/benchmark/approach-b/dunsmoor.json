      "content": "For most of human history, if you wanted to cook something, you had to build a fire. Last week, we got impatient when our frozen burrito wasn't hot in the center after two minutes in the microwave. So when you hear about a restaurant that goes out of its way to cook everything over wood, it makes you wonder: is all that effort really worth it? Or is it just a ruse to prop up Big Firewood? When it comes to Dunsmoor in Glassell Park, the answer is an unequivocal yes. From the beefy dry-aged ribeye to the stuffed whole trout to the roasted squash with ricotta, everything at this rustic, Southern-leaning restaurant has been kissed by the coals and tastes all the more spectacular for it. And it's not just the food that the fire improves, either. Housed in a cavernous Art Deco building, the dining room has a soft, amber glow that seems to radiate out from the fire in the open kitchen.\n\nThe chef of Dunsmoor used to run Hatchet Hall in Culver City, another rustic, Southern-leaning spot also known for having a big fire pit where they cook everything. The difference is that this restaurant leans even further into the bit: the hearth sits in full view of the dining room, surrounded by cast iron pots and pans and bouquets of herbs drying overhead. It might sound like a setup straight out of Colonial Williamsburg, but there's nothing stuffy or pretentious going on here. Although it was the subject of a passionate debate over gentrification when it first opened, Dunsmoor, which serves dinner seven nights a week, has the trappings of a neighborhood standby—the service is inviting, there's a cozy wine bar in the back that always has room for walk-ins, and the prices, while by no means casual, are reasonable for what you get.\n\nOur favorite dishes here come from the section at the top of the menu, made up of a handful of raw dishes and charcuterie. If you've had the incredible hatch chile and cheddar cornbread at Hatchet Hall, the one at Dunsmoor will taste very familiar, since it's the one dish the chef brought with him from his old restaurant. Imagine curling up on a cozy sofa if it were made of cornmeal and dreams—that's the experience of eating this. It's big, fluffy, and super moist, with a crunchy crust from the skillet it's baked in. Also, it's smothered in an obscene amount of honey and butter for good measure.\n\nWho would have guessed that a restaurant with a giant wood oven front and center would make one of the best plates of raw fish we've had all year? This stunner involves thick slices of seared rare albacore, spoonfuls of olive oil and bright ginger root relish, and a showering of crispy fried shallots, chives, and lemon zest. Put it at the top of your must-get list.\n\nListed under a section on the menu dubiously titled \"Happy Endings!\" desserts at Dunsmoor usually consist of a few old-timey-sounding treats made with seasonal produce, like a jammy persimmon cake, rhubarb pie, or sticky date pudding. Even if you're stuffed by the end of the meal, get one."

      "content": "The reams of butter, lard and salt are perfectly calibrated at Dunsmoor, a new eatery in Glassell Park with the same communal tables, wood-fired hearth approach to cooking and hit-or-miss service as its predecessor, Culver City's Hatchet Hall. Led by namesake chef Brian Dunsmoor, who left the Westside restaurant in April 2021, Dunsmoor has quietly built up a steady mix of clientele despite initial furor last summer by community activists angry about the predominantly Latino neighborhood's ongoing gentrification. Neither the Grant, the intimate cocktail bar next door, or Bub and Grandma's, which still buzzes daily with Angelenos visiting from all over, has drawn the same level of public ire from community members. The key difference, it seems, lies in the upscale menu prices, which are squarely out of reach for many area residents.\n\nWhether you consider this damning or not, the restaurant has managed to survive and thrive, making it clear plenty of diners care little for the ongoing ethical debate. In many ways, Dunsmoor has become a Northeast L.A. satellite serving a more unadorned but no less elegant form of the Southern decadence on hand at Hatchet Hall, which received a 2022 Michelin star under now-departed head chef Wes Whitsell. Where Hatchet Hall tends to sprawl—a recent menu features dozens of discrete offerings—Dunsmoor prefers to stay focused, with under 20 savory family-style dishes, plus a few sides and desserts. In Glassell Park, the chef's popular cornbread still drowns in what feels like two sticks of butter, but lighter fare like the baby albacore and the bison tartare add pops of freshness and zing with ingredients like ginger root relish and mullet roe, respectively.\n\nThe Vibe: Communal tables, an open kitchen and warm lighting make for an inviting upscale atmosphere fit for a neighborhood eatery. The Food: A highly focused menu of broadly Southern cuisine that includes well-dressed raw seafood, salt-forward larder meats, seasonal dishes and hearty meat and seafood mains designed for sharing. Highlights as of February 2025 include the grilled veal sweetbreads, mushroom-crusted pork chop and the chopped chicken liver. The Drink: Wine, beer, and one lonely non-alcoholic option that isn't water (Heineken 0.0). The selection includes sparking, white, rosé and red. Time Out tip: Solo diners and pairs on the earlier side will have an easier time being seated in the next-door wine bar, which has a separate entrance."

      "content": "Much of the Southern-inspired menu must pass through the wood-fired hearths—oysters, cornbread, rib eyes and pork chops. Nearly everything here offers some kind of hearty, no-nonsense kind of comfort. Highlights include the excellent pork and green chili stew; grilled quail with pepper jelly; and braised greens that bubble away by the coals all evening."
