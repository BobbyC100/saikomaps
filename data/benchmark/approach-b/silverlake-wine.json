      "content": "Silverlake Wine is more of a wine shop than an actual bar, but we don't care. These people know wine and they know how to have a good time drinking it. There is a wine tasting bar off to the side, but it fills up quickly, so expect to be standing room only most nights. You can come in here and pick up a bottle any day of the week, but the power move is to come in on a Monday, Thursday, or Sunday for their stumble-home-with-a-neighbor wine tasting events. Ranging from $15-$25 per person (and that includes cheese, hummus, and flatbread), these things fill up fast, so reservations are definitely recommended."

      "content": "Randy Clement, April Langford and George Cossette's Silver Lake storefront is the quintessential neighborhood wine hub. You might call it \"the People's Wine Store\" as the staff here take pride in defining themselves by their customers. No matter your speed—Armani and shades or board shorts and sandals—every customer gets the same treatment from an enthusiastic, knowledgeable staff who maintain their role to merely navigate the customer. You'll always discover something new as the selection—smartly chosen and constantly changing— is mostly small-production domestic and French with a smattering of natural European wines. In-store tastings are featured on Mondays and Thursdays. There's a free parking lot adjacent to store off Glendale Blvd and metered street parking in front."

      "content": "I go to Silverlake Wine for tastings nearly every week and never look at who is hosting, which I probably should have because I probably wouldn't have opened this Lo-Fi knowing they were hosting on Thursday. But then again, this cab franc is amazing, so there is a good chance I also would have said, \"Fuck it.\" This wine is so light and poppy but with a real depth to it. It reminds me of a great day-to-night outfit, except I did not get to night with this because I drank it all myself and I am totally fine with that. Oh, Silverlake Wine tastings. How I love you. Possibly too much. When the staff teases you about whether or not you're going to be able to enunciate words by the end of the evening, you are definitely riding the line of too much. Luckily, I don't give a shit about enunciating. And the staff is always offering me to get down on something delicious, and sometimes it's the beautiful J. Mourat."

      "content": "Twelve years ago, lightning struck the Los Angeles retail scene when Silverlake Wine opened in the heart of Silver Lake, a hilly, Eastside neighborhood. Within two years, it was the spot to shop for boutique, esoteric and affordable wines from hidden corners of California, France and beyond. Silverlake Wine, owned by Randy and April Clement along with George Cossette, has grown to include Everson Royce Wine & Spirits in Pasadena, which opened in 2012 and was named after the Clements' twin sons. In 2015, the three partners opened an additional Silverlake Wine and the Everson Royce Bar in the Arts District. Silverlake's selection is rooted in the time that both Clement and Cossette spent at legendary Los Angeles eatery Campanile, where Manfred Krankl built a list of wines not typically associated with California restaurants of the 1990s. Despite more competition among wine shops and bars in Los Angeles these days, the Silverlake Wine empire shows no signs of slowing down. We were all about esoteric, boutique, biodynamic, natural wines from the get-go. But if we were going to have a roomful of stuff that people haven't heard of, we had to show them what we were talking about."
