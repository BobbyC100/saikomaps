      "content": "I love Conan O'Brien. The \"In the Year 2000\" sketches, the Masturbating Bear, that time he sold Springfield a Monorail–I celebrate his entire catalog.\n\nIn his most recent exploits for Conan, O'Brien takes Associate Producer and whipping-boy-nemesis Jordan Schlansky to a tour and cupping at the Los Angeles roastery of our partners at Intelligentsia Coffee as some sort of Bizarro World punishment for purchasing an espresso machine on the company dime without permission.\n\nLike in his Clueless Gamer sketches, O'Brien acts as the Uninitiated, cracking wise about bean probes and his love of coffee creamer in his embarrassing, bad Dad-joke way (if your dad committed heart and soul to the joke and was a genius).\n\nO'Brien and Schlansky's coffee excursion begins with a tour of the roastery, led by Samuel Sabori, Intelligentsia LA's roaster and buyer, where the gang gets to watch the Gothot coffee roaster in action and we get to see O'Brien's tall red coif struggling against a hairnet, which is never not funny.\n\nThe real fun begins when the guys meet up with Eden-Marie Abramowicz, who just took second place at this year's Big Western barista competition, for a cupping and subsequent espresso tasting. Schlansky really lets his hair down and gives some unadulterated coffee opinions, and Abramowicz gets to live with the odd and singular experience of having been called \"beautiful\" by Conan O'Brien. O'Brien lets him prattle on at the cupping table, giving Schlanksy just enough rope to hang himself before siccing Abramowicz on him to drop some knowledge, much to O'Brien's delight.\n\nLater, O'Brien inquires about how Intelligentsia feels about adding flavorings to coffees, and introduces a bottle of his favoring, Chocolate Chip Cookie Coffee-Mate. Like all good Conan segments, this one ends with great shame for the host, in the form of a Chocolate Chip Cookie Coffee-Mate con panna disaster, and much spinning of the cupping table's Lazy Susan mechanism. Abramowicz makes them some espressos, Schlansky does some Giorgio Milos schtick, and O'Brien compliments here for having \"ripped him a new A-hole\", which, again, this is not something one is told every day by Conan O'Brien.\n\nSo what did video teach us? 1. Conan is still hilarious, 2. Jordan Schlansky is a pretty funny annoying straight man foil, and 3. if you buy an espresso machine without asking, the only consequence is a tour and cupping at a top-notch roastery."

      "content": "If you live in LA, you know how important it is to get your coffee on. And while the city has many diverse options for single-origin, third wave, micro-roasted coffee, nothing beats the granddaddy of artisanal coffee: Intelligentsia. Both the Venice and Pasadena locations offer up quite a scene, but for now, here are the 11 folks you're likely to encounter at the Intelligentsia in Silver Lake.\n\n1. The barista. With his tweed vest and tie tucked neatly into his shirt, he's dressed as if it's 1930s Russia with the austere personality to match—which makes sense seeing as you just stood in line for an hour to acquire something that should be pretty easy to get.\n\n2. The coffee snob. Commissary. Bru. Lamill. He hates them all. He barely likes Intelligentsia. He's the guy who sits at the bar making incessant small talk with the baristas about the subtle notes of elderberry and brown butter in his Americano. \"Why ruin your coffee by adding cream or sugar? I'm a purist.\" He applied for a job at this Intelligentsia, but didn't get it because even they thought he was too pretentious.\n\n3. The scene girl. The common LA stereotype is that no one ever leaves the house without full hair and make up—unless you're in Silver Lake where you dress up to look like you didn't dress up. From the 1980s Alf sweatshirt to the perfectly coordinated clashing pants, every inch of her is styled without looking like she tried. Her daily trip to Intelligentsia is more about having people look at her than getting her morning cold brew.\n\n4. The 1890s hipster. Modern life has allowed him the luxury to live as if it is the late nineteenth century. His perfectly curled villain mustache gives him the guilty look of someone who just tied his girlfriend to a train track. Right now, he's taking a break from his antiquated profession (artisanal metal welder?) to indulge in a 2015 pleasure.\n\n5. The trust fund hipster. Living in Silver Lake can be expensive, especially when you add a $5 per day latte habit to the mix. Thankfully, his parents pay his rent so he can spend his days walking to Intelligentsia (because it's totes green), idly read half a chapter of a self help book, journal his thoughts and pretend like he's doing something with his liberal arts degree.\n\n6. The \"writer.\" She has a whole folder of unwritten screenplays. She's wearing headphones. Is she listening to music or is she just trying to silence the latte machine? Doesn't really matter, because she isn't doing anything productive. Facebook. Twitter. Then back to Facebook. Can't wait to read that buddy comedy with the hilarious premise you keep talking about.\n\n7. The writer. She's on her third cup of coffee, and it's not even 11am. She has a set schedule.\n\n11. The guy with the clean shaven face. This guy is particularly noteworthy for being the only person at Intelligentsia who does not have facial hair. Even the most hairless of German men are still attempting to grow patchy, scraggly hipster beards. He stands out like the only man at a Liz Phair concert. What's he doing here? Avoid him at all costs."

For sustenance, look to the the shop's small but tasty selection of pastries, or venture to Pharmacie du Vin next door for freshly made sandwiches. Then settle in with your cuppa to see and be seen."

With more space, light and parking (and beer) than its East and Westside cousins, the Pasadena location just may become the most popular. Of course, \"popular\" doesn't always mean \"best\"—and you will indeed find better within a few blocks—so consider this trendy, somewhat tired spot a handsome standby."

On weekdays, this mosaic-tiled cafe in Silver Lake doubles as a workspace for screenwriters and graphic designers suffering from acute caffeine dependency. Set up shop at the counter as you furiously reply to Slack messages and order your third americano of the morning.\n\nCome weekends, there's a noticeable shift. Intelligentsia turns into the official sponsor of the Adorable Dog Olympics, where hot people who unironically wear trucker hats show up for cold brew and an excuse to show off Rico, their Shiba Inu. If you have a cute dog, and an Instagram account for them, you'll fit right in."
