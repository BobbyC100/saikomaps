      "content": "The name of this neon-lit Korean pub will make sense when you step inside: the room practically vibrates with electronic K-pop tunes. They're known for buldak cheese—a skillet of spicy, chargrilled chicken with a cheese blanket torched tableside—but the fantastic chicken wings should be your first order. Choosing between 13 flavors is daunting, but we prefer the honey nutty butter for savoriness with a tinge of sweet, or something with heat like the lemon jalapeño or chili-garlic. There are a few wild-sounding flavors, like one topped with sticky, stir-fried anchovies and shishito peppers, but don't write them off, as they're surprisingly delicious."
