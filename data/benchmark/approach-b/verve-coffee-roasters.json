      "content": "Our friends and partners at Verve Coffee Roasters, the plucky Santa Cruz roaster and 2012 Sprudgie Award winner, opened the doors of its first brick-and-mortar Los Angeles location today. I toured the space in advance of its soft open this weekend, and spoke more about the project with Verve co-founders Colby Barr and Ryan O'Donovan, along with Verve CEO Chris Jordan, formerly of Dormans Coffee, Technoserve, and Starbucks. They were joined by Juice Served Here's Matthews & Alterman.\n\nThe resulting cafe feels utterly Californian, and at the same time big-city and urban. It is exactly the sort of space you'd expect to find in Downtown Los Angeles; one could be blindfolded, spun around three times, dropped there with no knowledge of place, and be reasonably expected to determine its whereabouts.\n\nFloor-to-ceiling panels of glass separate the cafe and juice space from Studio MAI. The space is bright and open, with blonde myrtlewood inside and and South American ipe woods outside, exposed concrete (we're talking big 1940s cinder blocks), and braided denim. Nary an Edison bulb can be found, but rather big opaque modern white light fixtures and black midcentury lamps. The floor of the cafe was inspired by Vox amplifier grills, and nods to the Verve team's musical affinities. There are potted plants throughout. The service and coffee production bar is composed of reflective mirrors, with more blonde wood on top.\n\nThe reinvention (or perhaps, rediscovery) of coffee as a gateway to the good life is well underway, and co-branding efforts are riotously en vogue right now, from Portland to Amsterdam, Manhattan to Tokyo. But here, in downtown Los Angeles, a new bar has been set in the arms race for tasteful cafe curation.\n\nBaristas are clad in Hedley & Bennett Verve custom aprons, designed and stitched just a few blocks away and made of Japanese 7oz selvedge denim. The cafe will sell magazines like Monocle, Kinfolk, Darling, The Surfer's Journal, and Stay Wild. Also on offer are leather products and jewelry from Clark & Madison, body care products from Aesop, blank journals from Public Supply, custom ceramic mugs from Kat & Roger, and espresso service vessels from notNeutral.\n\nIt boasts three steam wands, and is very aesthetically beautiful, frankly. Espressos from the Spirit are served up on notNeutral custom wood serving trays. Guests can expect multiple coffee offerings each day, including Verve's anchor Street Level espresso, selections from Verve's Reserve program, and a shifting variety of single origin coffees sourced in part by Verve co-founder Colby Barr, who still manages the growing company's green coffee portfolio. Devin Chapman, a seasoned barista competitor with a Portland pedigree, has been closely involved with the development of Verve's inaugural Los Angeles cafe, managing the space at 833 while training for competition at the upcoming United States Barista Championship. \"We'll be developing specialty drinks with juices,\" Chapman told me, \"and my signature drink will be on the menu after USBC.\"\n\nI asked Barr to explain the relationship between Juice Served Here and Verve at 833 S. Spring. \"It's a collaborative store,\" he told me, echoing Matthews. \"It's not two stores in one, it's not a pop-up, it's not a divided space. We wanted this to be a cohesive space. It's kind of a concept store–it's coffee and juice, which are, like, best friends. We've been working with Juice Served Here before they opened. They started using our cold brew concentrate to go with their raw juices. Since then we've been talking to them about partnering with them on juice. We felt like it was a better customer experience to have one place that featured Verve Coffee and Juice Served Here.\"\n\nAlong with coffees, smoothies, and juices, the cafe will also serve Verve-partnered Dr. Kefir's sparkling fermented beverages on tap, as well as Verve's nitro cold brew."

No need to feel intimidated, though—Santa Cruz-based Verve Coffee Roasters isn't doling out judgement, just really good coffee and juice from Juice Served Here (free samples at the cashier!) in one of the prettiest coffee shops in DTLA.\n\nPlants hang from and creep up the walls of the outside patio; inside, communal tables and wooden benches are filled with people sketching designs and tapping away at the next Great American novel (free Wi-Fi, holler). If you're a first-timer, try the Bowl of Soul, Verve's signature drink that combines your choice of tea with homemade almond milk for a drink that gives you all kinds of good feels."

The all-day menu features a flexible kind of global cuisine, not to mention a handful of truly good coffee-based mocktails exclusive to that space. Of course you'll also find the signature Verve beans available for purchase, along with other home coffee staples like filters and pour-over systems. Given all this, the breezy atmosphere and that dog-friendly patio (plus some free parking), and we've probably found your new favorite coffee shop. You can thank us over some banana sesame pancakes."
