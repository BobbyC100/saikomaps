      "content": "I recently had the opportunity to interview Lou Amdur, the proprietor of Lou Wine Shop in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Los Feliz. Amdur is a great interview, as you'll discover below, a Minneapolis native by way of New York City who peppers his conversations with sociology and philosophy concepts, and is as generously knowledgeable about wine as anyone you'll meet. But it's what happens around the interview that I keep coming back to now in my memory, playing it over and over again as I try and frame exactly why this place is special, why it stands out among other wine shops, and why you should care.\n\nThe interview itself happens inside Maru Coffee (Amdur loves coffee) just a block or so away from Lou Wine, over a rapid-fire hour of conversation. But the best stuff happened away from my laptop—it's always this way—in the casual conversation going on between Lou and the street scene in Los Feliz.\n\nThe a-ha moment happens here, away from the interview itself. The hook for this story is pretty simple: Lou Amdur is the vinous mayor of Los Feliz. There is an irresistible magnetism to how he approaches community that transcends the wider hang-ups we Americans have around wine, and it's helped him build his shop into a dual threat: a neighborhood institution that is also a natural wine geek destination. Lou Wine has an orbit, one that makes you feel lucky and grateful to be spinning around for a few revolutions. It's a special place, and while the wine and conversation below with Amdur was an absolute privilege for me to have, it's nothing compared to the chat and bottles waiting there for you.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nHey Lou, thanks so much for talking with Sprudge Wine. How did you first get started in wine?\n\nI worked in software for a long time, in New York and here, but I began to really fall for wine in the late 90s. I began to notice that I was bringing my wine books to work, and closing the door in my office and reading my wine books instead of coding. After 9/11, I decided I didn't want to do business travel anymore for stuff I wasn't passionate about. Not to put a silver lining on a horrendous human event, but a lot of people evaluated what they were doing at that moment. My wife and I were in Paris at a neighborhood wine bar and I realized there weren't any in Los Angeles. And I thought, that's a way to exit software and I had this fantasy that it would be a low barrier to entry. I thought the threshold was low. What I didn't realize is that in Los Angeles to do a pure wine bar, at least at the time, was extremely challenging. If you're not in a neighborhood that's pedestrian-centric, they're not gonna drive.\n\nIt was called Lou, actually, and it was on Vine in Hollywood. I loved that restaurant, but it didn't work. After I sold the restaurant, having a shop was the next idea. It would help me bring my focus back to the wine. And that's worked—although, you know, in any business there's a lot of boring shit you have to do. A chunk of my life every week is recycling and sweeping and cleaning the bathrooms. I have no illusions about it being a posh lifestyle. But, yeah, there's a lot more time to focus on wine. Although I miss having my restaurant, and I may do another one in the future.\n\nDo you consider Lou Wine to be \"a natural wine shop\"?\n\nI'm not Taliban about it, but it's important to me. Natural is something we look for. Not all the wines we sell are natural, though; a wine might be organically farmed but it's not natural because it's inoculated. There's a range of these things in wine, and inoculation is the way down there. I think the most interesting wines are wild yeast fermented, but I eat bread. I eat bread all the time that has been inoculated with selected yeast and it's delicious. I'm not angry at that bread. I don't say it's industrial bread. But it's exciting to be in natural wine and I want to support folks who are making their wines in a traditional manner.\n\nThere's nonverbal cues. And I'll ask things point blank. \"Do you want funky wine? Are you gonna eat?\" That's the most central thing. If somebody asks for a certain type of wine you already know ahead of time they don't want something freaky. But when people say, \"I'm just getting into wine, I'm a beer guy,\" that's a fun job because you can give them interesting wine that tastes like a beer. Try this Lambrusco with carnitas—try it nice and cold and tell me what you think. That's fun.\n\nYou've been working around natural wines for a decade, and Lou Wine is a real destination for wine in this style. Are people asking for them more now? Has the market for it changed in LA?\n\n10 years ago, I organized a natural wine week in Los Angeles, and it was like pulling teeth. Nobody wanted to participate. It was a thing a couple of wine buyers knew about it. That's how the old timers did it and they did it for a reason. It helps polish the rough edges. And it's a perfect example of a wine that's fucked up and I love selling it to people. The wines are delicious, but if all you've had are $20 or $40 Chianti Classicos in your life, you try this and it's like, \"Here's the good stuff.\"\n\nWine culture in Los Angeles feels like there's some serious momentum behind it in 2017. Are you seeing the same thing?\n\nLA is such a centripetal city. Everything is pushed out. It's a city in which the downtown doesn't really matter unless you work or live or go to dinner there. It's hard to understand what's happening in our wine culture, because unlike in New York, if I wanted to hang with someone in Beverly Hills after their shift, well, I don't want to schlep to Beverly Hills and drink and drive home."

This strip-mall spot specializes in \"natural and unusual wines,\" including a bunch of lesser-known, biodynamic Eastern European options. If you call, you'll probably talk to Lou himself, and he can recommend a bottle for whatever reason you're buying wine. Order on their website, or pick-up in-store."

      "content": "Hi Lou, we'd love for you to start by introducing yourself. I opened my wine bar in Hollywood in 2005. My inspiration was the French bar à vin, which I'd discovered and fallen for on my first trip to Paris. After many trips to France, I found myself one cold winter night alone in a rental car on a dark road, in the southwest of France, en route to the town of Auch to eat cassoulet and more importantly drink the local wines and it began to dawn on me that I needed to try to fix this situation. Leaving my software gig was one of the scariest times of my life. I still recall sitting in the parking structure on my last day, after surrendering my security badge, with my box of personal possessions perched on my passenger seat and thinking, \"what have I done?\" After seven years, I sold the business with the idea of opening a wine shop. I thought it would be easy to find a new location, but I was mistaken. Once you set parameters for a business location, e.g., for me, no more than a five mile radius from my home (this is the advice I give fellow ex-pat New Yorkers: one key to sanity in Los Angeles is, if you can, not schlepping in your car during rush hour), I realized just how misguided I was. There's a tremendous competition for street-level retail space in Los Angeles, and it took me a year and visits to over thirty spaces to find a good fit. So, here I am in Los Feliz, running a neighborhood wine shop where our customers can walk in any night of the week (at least they could before the pandemic) and find something that's ready to drink, to enjoy with tacos, pizza, or a something from the dispensary. We focus on wines that are farmed organically and made without added chemical garbage.\n\nWe all face challenges, but looking back would you describe it as a relatively smooth road? I think in a fairytale world, starting a new business is magic, but in reality I don't believe it is a smooth road for anyone. We've been in business now for nearly seven years: it's gratifying to have many regulars because it indicates to me that I'm doing something that folks value, but there are also so many dimensions of my business that I know I could execute with more grace and efficiency.\n\nWith selling wine, I think it's important to recognize that just because you love something, there's no guarantee that anyone else will; thinking otherwise is merely an exercise in narcissism. Then again, it's my name on the sign above my storefront. That said, I didn't start a wine shop to peddle products that are a function of market research and psychographic modeling, for better or worse. We try to stock wines that are farmed well, made without added crap, and ideally say something about the sensibility and traditions of the people that grow them. One way we reduce the risk of narcissism is by soliciting ongoing customer input. We host weekly tastings, sometimes as many as four per week. They're invaluable for us as we get real-time feedback. This practice is on hold during the pandemic, and we and our customers eagerly await a time when we can safely resume in-store tastings.\n\nThanks for sharing that. So, maybe next you can tell us a bit more about your business? We're a neighborhood wine shop, selling an ever-changing roster of wines. Nearly everything we sell is organically farmed and fermented only with wild yeasts. Risk taking is a topic that people have widely differing views on – we'd love to hear your thoughts. Starting any business is a risk. You can arm yourself with a Nobel-prize winning business plan, work hard, work smart, and it's still a risk. You might have a brilliant idea, or at least you think you do — you may be deluded. You may be insufficiently capitalized, you may not understand the market, you may underestimate your competition, and you'd be in good company if you fail. Or, a once-in-a-hundred-years event like the SARS Cov-2 pandemic can take the wind out of your sails, through no fault of your own."

      "content": "Lou Wine in Los Feliz specializes in \"unusual wines,\" and a quick look at their website makes that abundantly clear - you'll find options like medieval grape varieties, traditional Basque whites, and German wines aged in clay pots. Sure, you can walk into any Trader Joe's and get a decent bottle of wine. But nothing compares to the depth of selection and knowledge of the staff at a local wine shop, where you can tell an employee, \"Hm, I don't know, I like steak?\" and they'll present you with the perfect bottle of beaujolais, like they're some mystical wine matchmaker. So we put together this list of a dozen Los Angeles wine shops - and a couple restaurants that act like wine shops - where you can get a bottle of red, a bottle of white, perhaps a bottle of rosé, or, you know, a bottle of orange (sorry, Billy Joel)."
