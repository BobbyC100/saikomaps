      "content": "Little Ripper is an Australian cafe by day, which means they have great coffee and a breakfast menu full of smashed avocado and vegemite toast. But right around 4pm, this daytime bistro says goodbye to the laptop crowd and transforms into a serene natural wine bar. That's when servers start to make small talk about pottery and recommend something \"funky yet refreshing\" by the glass. Regardless of the time of day, Little Ripper's checker-floored dining room is a non-intrusive backdrop for people who want to get some work done or hold hands and giggle over scallop crudo and chicory salad in Glassell Park. The best seats are right along the string-lit sidewalk patio. Don't be surprised if you find yourself surrounded by 30-somethings in linen outfits behaving like retirees on holiday in Sydney. Pretty Good: You'll likely be satisfied by a meal here, especially for a specific situation. Little Ripper is part-coffee shop, part-wine bar and an easy move for date night in Glassell Park."
