      "content": "After building a mini-empire of Italian restaurants (Jame Enoteca, Ospi, Jemma Hollywood), the chef behind them is jumping from pasta to tacos. Jaime Taqueria in El Segundo has a patio full of pink chairs and a lineup of tacos, burritos, guac, ceviches, and margaritas. The time you show up can work in your favor—there's a daily Happy Hour from 3-5:30pm with $12 margs, and a daily lunch special that includes two tacos and a marg for $25. We haven't been here yet, but want you to know this spot exists."
