Picaresca ethically sources its coffee beans from Mexico, Colombia, and Ethiopia and roasts them locally for optimal freshness. You'll find all of the usual coffee drinks on the menu, but the signature is the cafe de olla latte that's sweetened with a housemade syrup made of orange peel, cinnamon, and star anise. There are a handful of tables in the market where you can drink your coffee and eat a chile relleno-stuffed burrito or eggy breakfast sando with smoky-sweet mulato chile jam.\n\nUnrated: This is a restaurant we want to re-visit before rating, or it's a coffee shop, bar, or dessert shop. We only rate spots where you can eat a full meal."

      "content": "Picaresca Barra de Café opens a second Boyle Heights location, expanding its beloved community-driven coffee shop rooted in East LA.\n\nPicaresca Barra de Café, located in Boyle Heights, has become the latest craze in the community for its delicious food and customizable coffees, which have helped it gain immense support from neighbouring companies and locals. Currently sitting on the corner of 4th St. and Evergreen Ave., owners Leo Abularach and Elisa Hoyos have decided to expand their storefront to a second location, still located in the Boyle Heights area, and is set make its grand opening in early February. The company started off in a small coffee shop during the global pandemic and later expanded to a bigger storefront location in 2024.\n\nPicaresca has become a core part of the community, attracting people from all over the L.A. Abularach and Hoyos are grateful that their company is on the rise. However, their success goes far beyond their own. They are huge advocates for the community they are working in and use a bulletin board to announce different events around the area. Along with that, they use this board as a way of protesting against ICE raids that have taken over the L.A. area. Picaresca is also proud to say that they sponsor a youth soccer team and house their championship trophy at their first location.\n\nAbularach and Hoyos knew they wanted to keep their company grounded in their roots. Despite getting offers to branch out to the Pasadena area, Boyle Heights is where they grew up, so it was without a doubt that they were going to keep their different Picaresca Locations close in distance. Their second location sits on 8th St. by Olympic Blvd. and was formerly known as Tio Pepe's Mexican Restaurant. This location will offer a wider selection of coffees, pastries and dishes such as their blue corn masa waffle topped with fresh fruit and their café de olla syrup.\n\nPicaresca offers everything people want in a coffee shop: good food, good drinks and a home-like ambiance that allows everyone to feel welcomed. Customers love the character and cozy atmosphere these locations provide upon walking in, which makes them want to come back for more."

      "content": "Picaresca Barra de Cafe is a hidden gem tucked away in a mini-mall, but customers keep coming back for their Matcha de Olla and El Pino Latte. On South Soto Street, there lies a mini-mall with multiple shops. Through a narrow hallway and past a flower shop, the mini market and a barbershop is a small spot called Picaresca Barra de Cafe. The area around the cafe feels cozy with multiple chairs lining the left wall and a mini-table right next to the door. A mirror with writing that reads Con Amor y Rebeldia and art from local kids in the community hangs on the walls. Once inside the shop, the fragrance of espresso and pan hit your nose. The sounds of the espresso machine and the sizzling grill fill the air.\n\nBecause the pandemic came, Hoyos said \"I was out of work.\" \"Leo was able to find a job at another coffee shop.\" The isolation gave them the time to sit down and plan to open their own shop. The two saved their stimulus money from the pandemic and came across a location on Craigslist with a surprisingly low price. The location was previously a biónico and juice bar. The owner had been at the location for more than a decade and was looking to retire. The space had everything they needed for a coffee shop. \"It was kind of ready to go so we didn't have to build anything from scratch, which has saved us a lot of money,\" Hoyos said. After painting and purchasing some additional equipment, they just needed to come up with their branding. Drawing inspiration from the Spanish novel \"Don Quixote\" and the picaresque fiction genre, they named their shop Picaresca Barra de Cafe.\n\nThirty-five-year-old Leo Abularach, the other owner, roasts the cafe's signature coffee in Downtown Los Angeles, sourcing beans from countries like Ethiopia, Kenya, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Mexico. For food, there are burritos, wraps, breakfast sandwiches, and a waffle breakfast sammie. Whittier Bakery supplies the pastries – which include fresh pan dulce, sweet conchas and strawberry pies. The cafe also incorporates other food items from local businesses in its menu and weekend popups. The unique menu items, service, and atmosphere is what drives customers to keep returning. \"The staff here is really sweet,\" said Boyle Heights resident Gamal Sharaf El Deen. \"They're always kind with a great attitude. I also love the setting. There's something really charming about it.\" The owners both started working as baristas in college.\n\nHoyos said in the future, the two hope to add another Boyle Heights location. Their goals are to keep engaging with the community and to grow and uplift those around the area by providing quality coffee, food, and products. Customers who frequent the spot say they appreciate the personal touch of the cafe over chain coffee spots. \"Picaresca also celebrates our culture in a way, with their coffee names and combinations,\" said customer Cumplido. \"It's like a nod to our Boyle Heights upbringing.\""
