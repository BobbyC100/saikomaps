      "content": "Quinn Kimsey-White has created Psychic Wines—a new Los Angeles wine shop at 2825 Bellevue Avenue, open today—with the intention of building community. As with any fringe group gaining recognition, there has been a move towards exclusivity in the US natural wine scene in recent years—if something is popular, can it possibly be cool? Kimsey-White is wary of this, welcoming the newer discoverers of natural wine. \"We have to stay inclusive,\" he says, \"or run the risk of becoming the elitist wine culture that we countered ourselves against in the first place.\" Originally from North Carolina, he comes more recently from the Bay Area natural wine scene, which he describes as tight-knit and rightfully self-assured. In LA he sees \"an abundance of loose and outward-looking, unpretentious excitement.\" With early torchbearers like Jill Bernheimer of Domaine LA as influences, Kimsey-White anticipates the advent of a second wave of incoming personalities and establishments fleshing out the scene.\n\nThe shop is on a quiet street on the border of Silver Lake and Echo Park, an airy space with a mellow energy. Until now, the area has lacked in retail shops focusing on natural wine, despite the fervent interest of some of its residents. It's a bustling zone, but Kimsey-White intentionally positioned Psychic off the main drag so that it will offer the intimacy of a neighborhood shop. \"But also,\" he says, \"we just really love the block we're on. The building is old and full of character, people in the neighborhood are friendly and enthusiastic.\" He's excited to get bagels from Maury's, \"the best bagel shop in Los Angeles,\" another newcomer soon to be open on the corner.\n\nBeyond carrying wines from small producers who work properly and make real wine, he finds a connection with the winemakers important. Kimsey-White has visited many of the producers he stocks, and can honestly vouch for the work that they're doing.\n\nWhile the shop will not have a wine bar element, Kimsey-White has still found a way to make a cultural impact and increase a feeling of inclusivity with a wine club, called \"Visions.\" Subscribers will receive two to four bottles a month of \"wines that we actually give a shit about,\" as per Kimsey-White. Included will be a booklet of ephemera: visuals, info, wax poetic on the wines, and a written recipe and Q&A with someone who cooks around town in LA.\n\nThe name Psychic Wines, for Kimsey-White, refers to the unnamable qualities of natural wines, the metaphysical presence they can have, their connection to mind and soul."

There's a high likelihood that you won't recognize a single bottle in the shop, since they source from tiny vineyards randing from Mendocino to Liguria. They've also got a great selection of conservas to go with whatever you pick. Curbside pick-up and app delivery available."
