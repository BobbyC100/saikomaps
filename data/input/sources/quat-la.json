      "content": "Quat is a concept from the Kumquat people in Glassell Park that includes a cafe, retail shop, roasting room, and a forthcoming coffee omakase bar. The people behind Kumquat, Loquat, and Fondry (three places that always seem to have a crowd) have opened their largest space yet. Quat Coffee in Glassell Park looks like a tech startup headquarters with distinct departments. The cafe section serves drinks like the Claud Cooler with oolong tea, green plum extract, and butterfly tea flower, and The Copenhagen with espresso and spiced cider syrup. There's also a retail shop, roasting room, and a \"coffee omakase\" bar called Atelier Q opening soon. We haven't been here yet, but want you to know this spot exists."
