      "content": "Shawn Levy literally wrote the book on the Chateau Marmont. The author checks in with MICHELIN Guide to explain how the legendary hotel became a haven for celebrity mischief almost immediately after opening its doors.\n\nChateau Marmont was conceived in the late 1920s by Fred Horowitz, an attorney who dreamed of owning an apartment building on an unpaved road that connected the cities of Los Angeles and Beverly Hills. In an onion field on a rise above a bridle path called Sunset Boulevard, Horowitz envisioned a tower of 43 apartments, with commanding views of all of Southern California. He directed an architect to mimic the lines of Chateau D'Amboise, a castle in the Loire Valley. Each unit would be fully self-contained, with a kitchen, an underground parking space, and double-poured concrete walls that were both earthquake-resistant and soundproof.\n\nIn February, 1929, Chateau Marmont, named for a tiny road on the western edge of the property, opened to tenants. And then, after just seven months, the calamitous stock market crash known as Black Tuesday put an end to the taste for luxury housing.\n\nIronically, the new owner wasn't interested in renting apartments at all. Albert E. Smith was one of the granddaddies of Hollywood, with dozens of firsts to his name as a co-founder of Vitagraph Studios. He'd sold the studio a few years prior and was investing in real estate. In Chateau Marmont, he saw a chance to appeal to tourists coming to Los Angeles for the 1932 Olympics. He refashioned it as a hotel, added a few private bungalows on the grounds, and staffed it with former movie performers. The Chateau caught on with Europeans who preferred pensione-style accommodations to full-service American hotels, and with Broadway actors and writers who were happy to come to Hollywood and take its money, but didn't want to be seen as going Hollywood — and thus relished accommodations that recalled New York. Perhaps most of all, the Chateau's guests enjoyed the natural privacy of the place.\n\nIn the mid-1930s, a Hollywood studio boss advised a couple of rowdy young actors new to town, \"If you want to be seen, go to the Beverly Hills Hotel. If you don't want to be seen, go to Chateau Marmont.\" For many years, that was true: Chateau Marmont, the legendary Hollywood hotel perched on the edge of the Sunset Strip, was one of the few places in the middle of movieland where celebrities could carry on like civilians without the press, their bosses, or their spouses finding out what they were up to. In part it was because the Chateau was smaller than such rivals as the Beverly Hills and the Beverly Wilshire, and lacked public gathering spaces where looky-loos might spy on famous faces.\n\nAs a result, Chateau Marmont retains an air of mystery, even though every day's news brings paparazzi shots of celebrities coming and going from the place. Indeed, the hotel has become notorious for hush-hush naughtiness, a reputation which some mischief-makers glom onto for a bit of free publicity. The 'no-tell motel,' the roadside inn that rents rooms by the hour, doesn't check IDs too closely, and never sees or hears or says anything about its guests, is, ironically, a model for elite hotels. Because whether they're getting up to shenanigans or not, the people who frequent five-star spots don't enjoy having their business spilled — at least not without their publicists' approval. If a hotel wants to attract famous guests, it must be luxurious and well-appointed, but it must also be discreet.\n\nSince 1929, Chateau Marmont has enjoyed a reputation for discretion, even during the years — decades, really — when it was unknown, ill-appointed, and even a bit seedy. Today it is a renowned luxury hotel with every amenity its guests can imagine, none more important than a tight-lipped staff. Even in an age when we are all paparazzi with telephoto lenses and printing presses in our pockets, the Chateau is the sine qua non of 'no-tell,' showing just enough skin to keep gossips interested but absolutely schtum when it comes to the privacy of its patrons. It is, paradoxically, famous for being secretive."

      "content": "Hotels don't come much more iconic than the Chateau Marmont. As much of a celebrity as the movie stars and rock gods that have resided in this stunning West Hollywood building over the decades, the fact that mere mortals can also set up shop in the Chateau (dropping the 'Marmont' is proof that you're in-the-know), is, quite frankly, wild.\n\nBuilt in 1927, for its first few years the Chateau was a residential building for transient members of the moving picture industry. Thanks to its niche look—there were many English Tudor mansions and Spanish casitas in Hollywood, but very few French castles—the Chateau attracted a steady stream of business. In the 1960s the rock stars discovered it—if you had a record deal, a fondness for psychedelics and a dislike of haircuts, it's likely you had a good time at the Chateau—and today, it remains a favorite of the movie and music industry.\n\nCourteney Love summed up the hotel's eternal appeal best, calling the Chateau: 'The setting of the most wonderful thrashings, trashings, wreckings, best-kept secrets, true lies, velvet mornings, bougainvillea purple hazes, honestly lovely purely lazy sexiest days that Los Angeles has ever had.' Hidden away behind that blooming bougainvillea and a dense thicket of evergreen trees, the hotel's entrance is more of a test than a front door. But if you work out how to get inside—the trick is to keep on walking past the garage and turn left at the end of the gray paving slabs—your kingdom awaits.\n\nIt's the perfect base for a debauched L.A. weekend, and equally, is one of the most homely-feeling hotels in the city. We'll level with you. The 63 rooms and suites are basic, but beautiful. You won't get the bells and whistles you do at slicker (and far more expensive) West Hollywood hotels.\n\nIf it's Hollywood history and L.A. lore you're after, then there is no better place to stay than the Chateau Marmont. It's chic in a way that Hollywood rarely is these days, and though it's certainly not cheap, it's a far better deal than some of the other luxe hotels in West Hollywood.\n\nFood at the Chateau's in-demand patio restaurant is more than decent, but this coveted outdoor space (taking photos is banned unless done very, very subtly) is more about high-powered Hollywood meetings than fine dining. The star power here is high—expect to see movers and shakers sealing deals over fries—and dinner reservations are reserved for hotel guests (or the rich and famous, or anyone willing to phone up and wait two weeks for a table). If you're not staying at the hotel but want a taste of the good life, anyone can swing by for breakfast or lunch. The garden seats are the best. If you have a room with a kitchenette, we recommend cooking for yourself.\n\n'I would not feel cheated by life if I died in Chateau Marmont,' wrote the chef Anthony Bourdain, who bore an extremely soft spot for the hotel. He would start he days on his bungalow terrace with coffee, the newspapers and scrambled eggs made in his en suite kitchen, accessorized with bacon, spring onions and sour cream."

      "content": "Now that we've covered the ground rules (and hopefully spared you any rejection), know that Chateau Marmont is as cool as expected. Hollywood lore and celebrity gossip practically drip from its green striped awnings, and basking in that aura is the most thrilling part of a meal here. That, and the near-certainty that someone famous will be in your vicinity, like Al Pacino picking at branzino in the lush courtyard, David Schwimmer grabbing drinks in the lobby, or the ghost of John Bonham riding his Harley Davidson down the hallways (true story). The unpredictability of who you'll encounter is invigorating as the bar's crisp $35 vespers, and both of them make Chateau's underseasoned food remotely palatable. You're here to pretend you're wrapping up an Oscars press tour with cocktails and feel famous via proximity to Sofia Coppola, even if such emotions last for the two hours allotted for your table.\n\nThe cocktails at Chateau Marmont cost more than most dishes on the food menu. They're also potent, so you don't worry about tasting $35 worth of vodka in your martini. The vesper is our go-to because it's light on Lillet and heavy on lemon peel.\n\nA refreshing lemony appetizer in need of salt, but good otherwise. The poached octopus is chewy but not rubbery, and the celery and hearts of palm add a nice crunch. We taste plenty of dry oregano, but again, not enough salt (maybe it's for guests with blood pressure concerns?). The out-of-season tomatoes are surprisingly juicy. If you need a vegetable, this will do.\n\nServe us a ball of quality burrata and we're generally happy. The garlicky pesto tastes great with the creamy cheese, but the jammy eggplant caponata with raisins is a tad sweet. We were told this is the Chateau's best dish, and we agree."

      "content": "With nearly a century of celebrity-studded history under its belt, the Chateau Marmont is the living, breathing embodiment of Hollywood, old and new alike. In 1929, the French-inspired hotel opened on Sunset Boulevard; in the decades since, the Chateau has earned a well-deserved reputation for glamour and mystique. Entire books have been written on the famous actors, musicians, industry execs and other creatives that have slept, partied and even died within its walls.\n\nThe Chateau doesn't post its restaurant menus online, but I'd gleaned an idea of what to expect from the hundreds of detailed online reviews posted about meals there. Like most other hotels, the fare here is familiar, pricey and aims to please. The full menu encompasses classics like Caesar salad and yellowtail crudo, plus what I like to call the Four Horsemen of Hotel Dining: A chicken, a fish, a steak and a burger. The signature cocktails start at $20 and above, putting prices on par with those of other establishments on the Sunset Strip.\n\nWe ordered two drinks from our friendly server: A $21 cocktail called the Tokyo Teese and a dirty vodka martini made with Belvedere (which turned out to be $29). By the time he came back to take our food order, we were slightly buzzed. I also had the game plan for our meal: the guacamole and chips ($18), the spicy tuna tartare ($33), the spaghetti bolognese ($39), the linguini and clams ($39) and a side of fries ($12).\n\nFor me, the closest visual comparison to the Chateau's courtyard might be Soho House in Paris, which I realize doesn't help most readers imagine the feel of the space. Other iconic L.A. hotel eateries like Tower Bar (inside Sunset Tower) and the Polo Lounge (at the Beverly Hills Hotel) also offer old-school cool vibes, but out of all classic Old Hollywood hangouts, my dark horse favorite is now the Chateau. The abundance of greenery, curtained dividers, and array of seating choices easily make it the most inviting among L.A.'s iconic hotel eateries.\n\nAs a person who visits restaurants and bars for a living, I generally pooh-pooh eateries best known for their vibes, but the Chateau Marmont is one of the few exceptions. The hotel eatery is definitely a vibes-first institution, but even someone with zero knowledge of celebrity culture or industry history would appreciate eating a simple meal in the courtyard. Plus, the straightforward menu was solid and the service was excellent."
