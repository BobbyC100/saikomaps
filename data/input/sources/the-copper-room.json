      "content": "This historic restaurant at the Yucca Valley Airport has been around since the 1950s, when regulars included Frank Sinatra and Gene Autry. It closed a few years back, but has now been restored with multiple dining rooms and a wrap-around bar perfect for martinis, eating delicious snacks like garlic shrimp toast, and pretending you're someone else for a few hours. This is the kind of place you come to on your first night in the desert, then return to every night after. Rating: 8 (Truly Excellent) - An 8 should be on your must-try list, because 8s are great. These spots are worth making an effort or crossing town for. The Copper Room is a revitalized Old Hollywood classic in Yucca Valley and a must-stop for anyone visiting Joshua Tree."
