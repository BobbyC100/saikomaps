      "content": "Cardinale Du Vin was once a more run-of-the-mill wine bar serving things like a charcuterie board and a hot dog, but now there's a chef from Bangkok running the kitchen, and the new Thai-inspired bar snacks have some fun twists. You'll find dishes like oysters with a fish sauce mignonette, skillet cornbread with chili butter melting on top, and a green curry with oyster mushrooms that's our favorite thing on the menu. Overall, it's a safe bet for making a solid first impression, or a low-key night when you just want to kill two hours gossiping and splitting a bottle of gamay.\n\nSkillet Cornbread: A kids'-meal-sized skillet, so you'll want to take small bites to make it last longer. The chili butter adds a nice hit of spice.\n\nOysters: Perfectly fine oysters, but the sauces are what make this special. It's fun to alternate between the seafood sauce and the punchy fish sauce mignonette.\n\nComparable Restaurants: Sam's Place in Highland Park is another wine bar with good food, but it does it's thing extremely well. Melanie is an excellent wine bar in Beverly Grove with good food and great service. Bar Siesta is a tiny tapas bar in Silver Lake that's perfect for any casual plans that involve drinking and snacks."
