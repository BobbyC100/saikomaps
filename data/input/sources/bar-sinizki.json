      "content": "Once during dinner at Bar Sinizki, we looked over from our bar stools out the front window and saw a man riding a horse. Everyone waved. At breakfast, we've sipped espresso on the front patio and watched locals hauling baguettes from Proof on their morning stroll and grocers from the shop next door taking flower deliveries. Squint hard enough and this stretch of Atwater Village feels like an actual village, one that Rick Steves might find while backpacking through the Alps. At the center of it all is Bar Sinizki, a casual all-day cafe from the Dune and Elf people that functions as the neighborhood front porch, a slow-paced idyllic bistro where people trickle in and out from morning through night for reliably great food, classic cocktails, and the opportunity to turn their phone over and not think about anything for a few hours.\n\nWe love that Sinizki only takes walk-ins, so you can slide into whichever dining space matches your energy that night. There's the tiny, retro-chic dining room with copper tile ceilings, checkerboard floors, and a white marble bar. Richard Linklater is furious he didn't film Before Sunrise here. Even late-night, when most people are at least two Boulevardiers deep, there's a quiet, sexy feel to the room. Dates cuddle at tables while jazz plays softly in the background. Half the people at the bar brought a book.\n\nIf you're looking for a livelier scene, there's the shrub-filled sidewalk patio which, when combined with the spillover crowd from Dune next door, morphs into a mini town square. You'll see neighbors crushing Fernet spritzes at lunch and married couples splitting gooey bar burgers and bumping into friends they know from run club.\n\nBar Sinizki serves a few morning-specific dishes like sunny-side eggs with baguette and cardamom french toast, but for the most part, the compact menu stays the same throughout the day. If the steak frites at Sinizki were a flop, we might have to revoke their cute little bistro membership card. Fortunately, they don't mess up meat and potatoes. The steak is tender and peppery, with a giant dollop of tarragon butter that slowly melts over the seared beef. The fries are crispy, salty, and a perfect McDonald's-level thick.\n\nDessert specials here change daily, but we've been haunted by this elusive bread pudding a la mode since trying it. If they have it, for the good of humanity, order it. Let's crowd-source this thing until it's added to the permanent menu."
