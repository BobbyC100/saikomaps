      "content": "It's not every day that you come across a hotel with a name like Gold-Diggers, but even more remarkable is the fact that the name might not be the most unusual thing about it. The original Gold Diggers was a bikini bar, which is exactly what it sounds like, and the sign still remains above the Santa Monica Boulevard entrance. Above the bar was a small residential hotel, and behind it was a rehearsal space where all manner of L.A. rock royalty is rumored to have practiced in their young and lean days. In short, it's a building (and a location) with plenty of character — perfectly suited to a modern-day rock-and-roll hotel. And that it is. Not only is it a richly textured and eclectic boutique hotel — one perfectly in tune with the tastes of the Los Angeles creative class — but it's also a recording studio and a cocktail bar complete with a stage for live performances. Rooms come with Sonos sound systems and carefully curated in-room record collections, as well as high-end 2920 Sleep beds dressed in Parachute linens, and a selection of locally sourced snacks and minibar items. You don't have to be a rock star yourself to stay here, but the idea is that if you wanted to cut an album by day, try out some new songs in front of an audience in the evening, and crash in one of the hotel's 11 rooms by night, you could do it all under one roof. And even if you're not, you're more or less guaranteed a memorable experience — the design, the art, the clientele, and even the East Hollywood location are a world apart from the rest of Hollywood's boutique hotels."

      "content": "When real estate mogul Dave Neupert purchased the club in 2015, he wanted to keep the volume up on the grunge and rock 'n' roll vibes while appealing to today's creative nomads. Los Angeles is no stranger to the multi-hyphenate. You're an actor-DJ-surfer-entrepreneur? Sure. Under the sunny skies of Tinseltown, you can be whoever, and whatever, you dream of. This is especially true with Gold-Diggers, a former bikini bar in East Hollywood that was recently transformed into a boutique hotel, bar, music venue, and recording studio. A self-proclaimed \"bed and beverage,\" the hotel moonlights as a music studio where one can drink, sleep, and record in one place. The building, a discreet black brick, two-story facade with a neon yellow sign on Santa Monica Boulevard, was originally built in 1924 to house an inn above a tavern. In the 1950s, it was the soundstage for American filmmaker Ed Wood's movies, including Plan 9 From Outer Space. Guns N' Roses and Jimi Hendrix are rumored to have used the space as an underground rehearsal studio, as well as the '80s thrash metal band Slayer, who left their graffiti on the walls. To enter the hotel, guests are given their own key code for a discrete entrance. Each of the ten apartment-style guest rooms have unique configurations, several with separate seating areas and large windows overlooking downtown Hollywood and its famous marquee. The downstairs recording studio, Gold-Diggers Sound, includes nine soundproof studios equipped for everything: rock, hip-hop, electric house. They're open 24 hours for jam sessions. To get the creative juices flowing, the recording studio seamlessly melds into the bar – which hosts nightly concerts and dance parties under the former bar's original disco-ball chandeliers. While music seems to fill the halls at all hours of the day, guest rooms are surprisingly soundproof and cozy (ear plugs might still be a good idea for light sleepers). After a long day in the studio or a night out on the Strip, sink deep into the plush beds with LA's favorite eco-friendly Parachute bedding and clean up with Malin + Goetz products. In the mini bars, hangover patches are at the ready, along with curated snacks, cold brew, and craft beers. The hotel takes the in-room sound system as seriously as the recording studio, with turntables, vintage vinyl, Sonos sound bars, and cassette players. Gold-Diggers lovingly restored Ed Wood's legendary soundstage to become Gold-Diggers Sound, designed by Kingsize Soundlabs with nine acoustically sound rooms that are equipped for audio and visual projects with keyboards, guitars, and full mixing boards. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant, but the front desk hands out drink tokens for the dimly-lit Gold-Diggers Bar downstairs. It's the type of place you go for \"just one drink\" and end up dancing with strangers all night during the all-vinyl dance parties and rotating DJ sets."
