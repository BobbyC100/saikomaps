      "content": "Compared to your average wine bar, this Frogtown spot looks as though it could exist on another planet. The lighting fixtures are made of porous, asteroid-like rock. There's a hypnotic glowing orb behind the bar, illuminating a fashionable Echo Park crowd with tiny designer bags. Cocteau Twins and Beach House mumble on a vintage sound system and murals of blue goddesses line the walls. Is it a tad campy? Sure, but at its core, Justine's is a fun bar with interesting wines by the glass and a substantial food menu that'll make you want to stay for dinner.\n\nWine folks will find plenty to nerd out on here, like Moroccan sauvignon blancs or Austrian oranges made with intracellular fermentation (don't worry, that goes over our heads, too). The best reason to turn post-work plans into a full evening at Justine's, however, is the Italian-leaning menu, which is some of our favorite vegan food in the city.\n\nLeafy greens can get sad and wilted once they touch a grill, but not this romaine. Justine's grilled caesar is warm, smoky, and wonderfully crunchy. We also love the creamy dressing that's sharp and just salty enough.\n\nTruly Excellent: An 8 should be on your must-try list, because 8s are great. These spots are worth making an effort or crossing town for."
