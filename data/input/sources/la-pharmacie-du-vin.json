      "content": "La Pharmacie is the kind of place you bring a date (or a few friends you actually like), on a sunny afternoon when you don't need to rush. It's a wine shop smack dab in the middle of that rust-colored stucco complex near the Sunset Junction sign in Silver Lake and its outdoor area resembles a courtyard in a Spanish villa. Sit next to a blooming bush of roses and eat charcuterie all afternoon like an off-duty (read: unemployed) model. All the wine on the menu is for sale in the shop, where sommeliers wear navy lab coats and hundreds of bottles line dark, wood-paneled walls."
