      "content": "Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo opened the original location of this easygoing Italian-American café in 2015, and it's been busy-busy ever since. The slender room is soaked in sun thanks to the skylights and features a long counter that stretches the length of the open kitchen. The team works the wood-fired grill and blazing oven with ease, the servers are on point, and even after all these years, the food is as charming as ever. There are plenty of pizzas, all of them with lightly charred edges and topped with everything from smoked ham to vodka sauce. But don't slouch on the rest of the menu, like the refreshing salads packed with veggies or the superb, house-made pastas. Spaghetti limone with breadcrumbs is a recent highlight. MICHELIN Bib Gourmand: good quality, good value cooking."

      "content": "We're confident that even if you've never been to Jon & Vinny's, you're still reading this with some preconceived notion of the place. After all, the East Coast-style Italian spot on Fairfax (with locations now in Brentwood and Slauson) has been the most talked about, hyped-up, and over-analyzed restaurant in LA since opening in 2015. And we certainly contributed to the noise. In our original 2015 review, we rated Jon & Vinny's a 9.3, making it one of the highest-rated restaurants on the site. We were blown away by the simple, well-executed pastas, razor-thin pizza with toppings like Yukon gold potatoes or ham and vodka sauce, and a cramped, cool space that felt like we were eating in the basement speakeasy of a Norwegian thermal spa. Sure, it took weeks to score even a midweek seat at the bar, but we were happy to do so all in the name of eating great food and experiencing a restaurant that had firmly centered LA in the national dining conversation. So, what's up with the place these days? We'll say this: There's still a lot to like about Jon & Vinny's, you just need to know how and when to use its best elements. For starters, always come for lunch. This has been a hack since 2015, but it bears repeating: Jon & Vinny's is open daily for lunch with the same menu as dinner and there are always tables available. Waiting weeks for a dinner reservation at Jon & Vinny's is simply not the best use of your time anymore, but come with a friend for a spicy gem salad, plate of bright orange fusilli, and burrata pizza at 12:30pm on a Tuesday? You'll walk away pleased. Another option is to do takeout or delivery. Even during peak weekend hours, takeout is smooth and seamless, the pastas are always the right temperature when you remove the lid at home, and most importantly, you don't have to wait half a moon cycle to eat it on a Saturday night. Of course, if you really want to get dressed up and show off your riskiest pair of shoes on a Friday night here, no one's going to stop you, but it also shouldn't be a priority. Jon & Vinny's is no longer the destination restaurant it used to be, and that's okay, because it's still a solid Italian spot that works great when it's convenient for you. No need to analyze it any further. This is still one of the best salads in LA and that's a mountain we're happy to die on. The lettuce itself is always perfectly crisp, the Calabrian dressing has a major kick of heat to it, and the bread crumbs on top provide even more of a crunch. It's not a meal at J&V's without a gem salad on the table. These hide down in the big meats section, but they make for an ideal appetizer. They're moist without being crumbly and even though it only comes with two, the meatballs themselves are big enough for a table of four to pick at."

      "content": "Hearty meatballs and homemade pasta are standout dishes at Jon & Vinny's, a Fairfax eatery rife with comfort food. While I don't think Jon & Vinny's is all that interesting of an Italian restaurant, I appreciate its ubiquity and consistency. These days, you can now find its excellent pancakes, mozzarella sticks and wood-fired pizzas in Beverly Grove, Brentwood, Slauson, Beverly Hills and Studio City. The Studio City location offers cocktails, while the Beverly Hills outpost offers a standing-room-only Helen's Wines countertop near the front for espresso-based drinks by day and pours of natural wine by night. Menu staples like the spicy vodka fusilli, chicken parm and Ham & Eazy (formerly known as the Ham & Yeezy) pizza are better than ever. My favorite savory dishes here include the garlic buffalo wings, Salad Days pizza (think chopped salad on a pie) and the straightforwardly delicious bucatini aglio e olio. For dessert, spring for the double chocolate cake or whatever else tickles your fancy—it's all pretty great. Just note that evenings at Jon & Vinny's all but require a reservation, but you can usually squeeze in for a relaxed lunch or have the place to yourself during breakfast."

      "content": "This is a neighborhood that loves Italian food (there are at least eight more Italian restaurants along San Vicente), and also wishes it was a bit cooler, and Jon & Vinny's Italian-American classics are absolutely cool. And as they've come west, they've barely lost a beat. The space has the same Swedish sauna look, but bigger, and the menu is unchanged. And everyone within a five-mile radius is lapping it up - at 2pm on a Wednesday it's full of ladies ordering salads with a side of pasta, and studio executives ordering multiple pizzas. Some things - the pizzas in particular - are a little inconsistent, but we suspect that won't stop anyone from visiting."
