## 📰 CRITICS & FOOD MEDIA — The People Shaping What Gets Attention

**Jonathan Gold** (1960–2018) — Los Angeles Times / LA Weekly
The godfather. First (and only) food critic to win a Pulitzer Prize. Wrote about taco trucks and strip-mall Oaxacan spots alongside Wolfgang Puck. Literally put LA food on the map. Every serious food person in this city works in the space he built. The documentary *City of Gold* captures it.

**Bill Addison** — Los Angeles Times
Gold's successor and currently the only regularly publishing restaurant critic in LA. James Beard Award winner. Former national critic at Eater. Writes the LA Times 101 Best Restaurants list. If Addison reviews it, it matters.
*Follow: @billyaddison*

**Tejal Rao** — New York Times (California Critic)
First-ever California restaurant critic for the NYT. Her "Where to Eat" lists and reviews bring national attention to LA restaurants. One of the three women of color who reshaped West Coast food criticism post-Gold.

**Jenn Harris** — Los Angeles Times
Food columnist, video host, producer. Also sits on the James Beard Restaurant and Chef Awards Committee. Shapes both coverage and recognition.

**Javier Cabral** — L.A. Taco (Editor-in-Chief)
The voice of L.A. Taco, which won the James Beard Award for Emerging Voice in 2020. Covers street food, taco trucks, neighborhood joints, and working-class LA food culture that mainstream outlets ignore. If Saiko Maps wants to represent the *real* LA, Cabral's coverage is essential.
*Follow: @jaborscabral / @lataborig*

**Toni Tipton-Martin** — Author, historian
2025 JBF Lifetime Achievement Award. LA native. Decades of work bringing Black foodways to the forefront. Former LA Times food writer. Wrote *The Jemima Code* and *Jubilee*. A towering figure.

**Danielle Dorsey** — Los Angeles Times
Senior food editor. 2025 JBF nominee for reporting on Black Thanksgiving traditions. Rising voice in LA food media.

## ☕ COFFEE — The Names Behind LA's Specialty Scene

**Kyle Glanville & Charles Babinski** — Go Get Em Tiger / G&B Coffee
Both are US Barista Championship winners. GGET is the closest thing LA has to a coffee empire — multiple locations, in-house roasting, consistently excellent. Babinski departed in 2020 but retains co-owner status. The gold standard for LA specialty coffee.
*Follow: @golosdtla*

**Jack Benchakul** — Endorffeine, Chinatown (Far East Plaza)
Former biochemist turned pour-over obsessive. Makes his own water. Personally prepares every cup. Open Mon–Thu only, never weekends. The most precise coffee in LA. Not a vibe café — a laboratory. The one the other coffee people respect.

**Jacob Park & Joonmo Kim** — Maru Coffee, Los Feliz / Arts District
Korean-American founders. Park is a certified Q Grader and head barista. Name means "mountaintop" in Korean. Minimalist aesthetic, Kalita pour-overs, rotating roasters. Expanding to Williamsburg and Beverly Hills. Design-forward in a way that's aligned with Saiko's aesthetic.
*Follow: @marucoffeela*

**Yeekai Lim** — Cognoscenti Coffee, Culver City / Fashion District
Locally founded, minority-owned. Single-origin espresso and pour-over only. Industrial-chic spaces. One of the OG specialty coffee names in LA.
*Follow: @cognoscenticoffee*

**Dayglow** — Silver Lake / WeHo / Larchmont
Multi-roaster model — features a different independent roaster each month. Creative specialty drinks (Totoro with black sesame, Elvis with peanut banana cream). The most "discovery engine" oriented coffee shop in LA.
*Follow: @dayglow*

## 🍷 WINE — The People Building LA's Natural Wine Scene

**Helen Johannesen** — Helen's Wines / Jon & Vinny's
Partner at Jon & Vinny's and owner of Helen's Wines (shops inside J&V locations). Beverage director for Animal, Son of a Gun, and the whole empire. Named Food & Wine Sommelier of the Year 2016. Focuses on natural, organic, biodynamic wines. Runs a wine club, classes, and hosted the *Wine Face* podcast. If one person is credited with uplifting LA's wine scene to "venerable status," it's Helen.
*Follow: @helenswines*

**Coly Den Haan** — Vinovore, Silver Lake / Eagle Rock
Sommelier, winemaker, and founder of Vinovore — the first wine shop in LA (possibly anywhere) to stock exclusively women-made wines. Queer and woman-owned. Uses an animal archetype system instead of traditional wine categories to make wine approachable. Previously opened The Must (2008) and co-founded Perch DTLA. Natural wine evangelist with zero pretense.
*Follow: @vinovore*

**Matthew Kaner** — Bar Covell, Augustine Wine Bar (co-founder)
Food & Wine Sommelier of the Year 2013. Wine Enthusiast 40 Under 40 (2019). Co-founded Bar Covell in 2010 with Dustin Lancaster — the revolutionary "no wine list" concept with 150+ wines by the glass. Also opened Augustine Wine Bar in Sherman Oaks. Has since divested and moved to consulting (Will Travel For Wine), SOMM TV hosting, and his History of Wine podcast. The guy who *defined* what an LA wine bar could be.
*Follow: @matthewjkaner*

**Domaine LA** — Fairfax
Renowned natural/organic wine shop. Knowledgeable staff, small-production focus. One of the serious wine-nerd destinations alongside Lou Wine Shop and Psychic Wines.

## 🌮 STREET FOOD & NEIGHBORHOOD INSTITUTIONS — The Soul of LA

**Kevin Bludso** — Bludso's BBQ, Compton / La Brea
James Beard Award winner (2023, cookbook). Compton barbecue institution. His *Bludso's BBQ Cookbook* won JBF Restaurant and Professional category.

**Wes Avila** — Guerrilla Tacos → Angry Egret Dinette
Started as a taco cart, became a brick-and-mortar, evolved into Angry Egret Dinette. Fine dining training applied to street food. The trajectory that defines modern LA food.

**Gilberto Cetina Jr.** — Holbox, Mercado La Paloma
JBF nominee (2023). Yucatecan seafood in a market stall. The kind of place that only exists in LA.

**Diep Tran** — Good Girl Dinette (closed)
James Beard Media Award winner for her essay "Dog S#!t Dacquoise." Vietnamese-American food voice in LA.

---

## 🥐 BAKERIES & PASTRY

**Gusto Bread** — Long Beach
2025 JBF Finalist for Outstanding Bakery. Sourdough-focused. One of the most talked-about bakeries in SoCal.

**Masienda** — Jorge Gaviria
JBF winner (2023, Commercial Media) for short films promoting his book *Masa*. Not a bakery per se but the premier masa producer in the US. Supplies LA's best tortillerías.

---

## 🍸 BARS & BEVERAGE PROGRAMS

**OTOTO** — Echo Park
Won JBF Outstanding Wine and Other Beverages Program (2023). Sake bar. The only sake-focused JBF winner in recent memory.

**Tobin Shea** — Redbird, DTLA
2025 JBF Finalist for Outstanding Professional in Cocktail Service. Bar director. The cocktail side of LA's fine-dining world.

**Strong Water** — Anaheim

## 🎵 MUSIC VENUES — Still a Gap

The seed list has 7 jazz-focused venues (The Baked Potato, Delilah, Bar Lis) with no editorial authority source. Potential sources to investigate:
- **LA Weekly** — historically the alt-weekly with music coverage
- **KCRW** — public radio, deeply embedded in LA music + food (hosts *Good Food* with Evan Kleiman)
- **LA Jazz Scene** — niche but focused

## How This Connects to Saiko Maps

This isn't just a reference list — it's a **credibility layer**. When SaikoAI enriches a place, the extraction prompt can now say: "This place was reviewed by Bill Addison in the LA Times 101" or "Featured by Javier Cabral in L.A. Taco" and that *means something* to the person viewing the map.

The who's who also maps to the source registry tiers. A mention by someone on this list = legitimate signal. The further down the list you go, the more it's confirmation rather than primary authority.

**Next step:** Wire these people/publications into the extraction prompt as named authorities, so the AI knows whose endorsement to weight highest when enriching each category.
