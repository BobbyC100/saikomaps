## 🎯 UI Component Data Requirements

### What's Working (Fields Available)
| Component | Needs | Status | Fallback |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Hero** | name, neighborhood, hours | ✅ | Meal context from hours |
| **Action Strip** | phone, lat/lng, instagram | ✅ | Hide actions when data missing |
| **Gallery** | photoUrls[] | ✅ | 10 photos available |
| **Curator** | curatorNote | ✅ | From mapPlaces.descriptor |
| **Coverage** | sources[] OR pullQuote | ✅ | Uses sources array |
| **Map** | address, lat/lng | ✅ | Works |
| **Hours** | hours JSON | ✅ | From Google Places |
| **Also On** | mapPlaces[] | ✅ | Works |

### What's Broken/Missing
| Component | Needs | Status | Impact |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Details** | website, restaurantGroup, service | ⚠️ | Card often empty |
| ~~**Vibe**~~ | ~~vibeTags[]~~ | **Deprecated** | Column removed; use `identity_signals.vibe_words` |
| **Meta line** | priceLevel | ❌ | No $$$ symbols |

## 🔧 Data Quality Issues

### Issue 1: Instagram in Website Field
**Problem:** Many places have Instagram URLs stored in `website` field, with `instagram` field empty

**Examples:**
- Seco: `website = instagram.com/seco.silverlake`, `instagram = null`
- Stir Crazy: `website = instagram.com/stircrazy.LA`, `instagram = null`

**Solution in Code:**
```typescript
// DetailsCard.tsx - Already fixed
if (website && !website.includes('instagram.com')) {
  // Show as Website
} else {
  // Show as Instagram fallback
}
```

**Long-term fix:** Backfill script to move Instagram URLs from `website` to `instagram` field

---

### Issue 2: No Price Levels
**Problem:** `priceLevel` is null for all test places

**Impact:** Meta line doesn't show $$$ symbols

**Options:**
1. Backfill from Google Places (has price_level field)
2. Manual editorial entry
3. Infer from other signals (neighborhood, cuisine, reviews)

---

### Issue 3: No Vibe Tags
**Resolved (deprecated):** `vibeTags` column has been removed from entities. Vibe signals now live in `identity_signals.vibe_words` via `golden_records`.

**Impact:** Vibe card never renders

**Options:**
1. Generate from editorial sources (extract descriptors)
2. Manual curation
3. LLM extraction from review text

---

## 🚀 Recommended Actions

### Immediate (UI Fixes)
1. ✅ Scale Curator text size (short notes = larger font)
2. ✅ Fix Map preview styling (grid texture + pin)
3. ✅ Details card Instagram fallback (when no real website)

### Short-term (Data Backfill)
1. **Instagram field cleanup**
   - Move Instagram URLs from `website` to `instagram`
   - Backfill real websites from Google Places
   
2. **Price level backfill**
   - Query Google Places API for price_level
   - Update existing places

3. **Vibe tags generation**
   - Extract from editorial sources
   - Manual curation for high-traffic places

### Long-term (Feature Enhancements)
1. **Service options** (Dine-in, Takeout, Delivery)
   - Add fields to schema
   - Fetch from Google Places
   
2. **Reservations**
   - Detect reservation URLs (Resy, OpenTable)
   - Flag as Recommended/Required
   
3. **Parking & Accessibility**
   - Fetch from Google Places
   - Manual editorial notes

---

## 📈 Data Health Score

**Current State:**
- Core fields (name, location, hours, photos): **85%** ✅
- Editorial content (sources, curator notes): **60%** ⚠️
- Enrichment fields (vibe tags, price, groups): **10%** ❌
- Reference data (service, parking, accessibility): **5%** ❌

**Merchant Page v2 works well with current data** because:
- Graceful degradation hides missing cards
- Core information (location, hours, photos) is solid
- Editorial content (Coverage, Curator) shows when available
- No broken layouts or empty states

**Future improvements** will come from data enrichment, not UI changes.

---

**Conclusion:** Data pipeline is working. Fields are just not populated yet. UI handles this gracefully.
